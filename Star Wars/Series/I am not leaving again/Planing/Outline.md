## Theme and Concept

| Main Theme |
| :------- |
| The story explores redemption and self-discovery for Ahsoka and Anakin, with each of them facing the consequences of past choices and discovering their own paths forward. It’s about finding inner peace and healing through relationships, challenging institutional beliefs of the republic and the jedi order, and discovering self-worth and autonomy in the face of regret and societal expectations. |

| Secondary Theme |
| :------- |
| This theme plays out through Ahsoka’s struggle for independence and Anakin’s need for acceptance and love. Their contrasting experiences with attachment — Ahsoka’s desire to help without losing herself, and Anakin’s journey to not define his worth through others’ expectations — highlight the importance of balancing love with personal identity. |

| Concept |
| :------- |
| In a galaxy on the brink of war, Ahsoka and Anakin reunite at their lowest, each bearing unresolved guilt and wounded loyalty. Together, they strive to heal and rediscover their purpose, testing their bond in the face of personal redemption, galactic upheaval, and the looming shadow of the Jedi Order’s fall. |

## Story Arcs
The story will have three main arcs, which let Anakin and Ahsoka progress through their journey of discovery and love, while different sub-plots start and culminate around them into the climax at the end of Arc 3

### Arc 1: Reconnection and Reflection

| Key Plot Points | |
| :------- | :------ |

| Pressure from Palpatine |

| Palpatine begins to notice changes within the clone forces, as members of the 501st and 212th begin to act more independently and show unexpected defiance. Sensing a threat to his plan, he increases his influence over the Jedi Council and tries to speed up his timeline, setting up the confrontation sooner than anticipated. |

| Climax of Arc 2 |
| :------- |
| Palpatine’s manipulations come to a head, and Ahsoka and Anakin stand up to the Council in a pivotal confrontation. They question the Jedi’s unyielding stance on attachment and are nearly expelled. However, they gain the quiet support of key figures like Obi-Wan, Rex, and even Yoda, who begins to understand the Order’s failures. |

### Arc 3: Redemption and Revolution
As tensions escalate in the galaxy, Ahsoka and Anakin fight to protect the Jedi Order from itself and from Palpatine’s corruption. The romance reaches its culmination, and they’re faced with the ultimate test of their loyalty to each other, their friends, and the Jedi.

| The Chancellor’s Deception | As Ahsoka, Anakin, Obi-Wan, Rex, and Cody connect the dots, they start to suspect that Palpatine may be orchestrating a larger scheme, including a sinister use for the biochips. They work in the shadows, preparing the clones who’ve removed their chips and strengthening their resistance against Palpatine’s control. |
| Obi-Wan and Yoda’s Realization | Seeing Ahsoka and Anakin’s defiance, both Obi-Wan and Yoda finally recognize the Jedi Order’s mistakes, leading to a climactic moment where they openly support Ahsoka and Anakin’s resistance against Palpatine. |
| Preventing Order 66 | When Palpatine finally executes Order 66, parts of the 501st and 212th who had their chips removed are able to resist. Rex and Cody rally their brothers, convincing them to turn against the Chancellor’s forces and support the Jedi instead. |
| The Showdown with Palpatine | The story culminates in an intense showdown where Ahsoka, Anakin, and their allies fight Palpatine and his loyalists. Here, Palpatine tries one last time to turn Anakin by manipulating his self-doubt and tempting him with power. Anakin’s acceptance of himself and Ahsoka’s support allows him to resist. |

| Ahsoka’s Growth |
| :------- |
| Ahsoka embraces her autonomy fully, realizing she can love and still remain true to herself. She’s become a leader, her defiance of the Council now validated as a new path forward for the Jedi. |

| Anakin’s Growth |

| Climactic Battle |
| :------- |
| With the resistance of the 501st, the 212th, and their Jedi allies, Ahsoka, Anakin, and Obi-Wan lead a direct assault on Palpatine. They work together to dismantle his hold over the Republic, exposing him as the Sith mastermind and preventing him from decimating the Jedi through Order 66.
 |

| Resolution |
| :------- |
| After Palpatine’s defeat, the Jedi Order faces a reckoning. Thanks to the influence of Ahsoka, Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Yoda, they begin to reform, embracing a more compassionate and flexible approach to attachment and emotions. |

### Slow-Burn Romance Development

- **Arc 1:** Ahsoka and Anakin begin rediscovering their bond as friends, with subtle hints of romantic tension.
- **Arc 2:** They face moments of vulnerability, moving closer through shared experiences and emotional support.
- **Arc 3:** Their feelings culminate in open confession and mutual acceptance, transforming their relationship into a source of strength for the climax.

## Supporting Subplots and Characters

1. **Obi-Wan’s Arc:** Obi-Wan’s evolving views on the Jedi Order parallel the primary arcs. He begins to question the Order’s rigid stance on attachment and emotion, gradually becoming an ally in the movement for change and ultimately defending Ahsoka and Anakin’s unconventional approaches.
2. **Rex and the 501st:** Rex’s loyalty and friendship become crucial as he assists Ahsoka and Anakin in their investigation and resistance against Palpatine. His role as a leader in the 501st and his decision to remove the biochip from himself (and later, from his troops) highlight the importance of trust and chosen bonds, which transcend traditional Jedi teachings.
3. **Padmé’s Influence:** Padmé’s presence complicates the budding romance, causing Ahsoka to confront feelings of jealousy and doubt while reminding Anakin of his past attachments. Over time, Padmé’s perspective shifts, and she comes to accept Ahsoka’s role in Anakin’s life, allowing Anakin and Ahsoka’s relationship to deepen without lingering guilt or unresolved feelings.
4. **Biochip Investigation:** Sparked by the suspicious death of Fives, Ahsoka and Rex embark on a journey to uncover the truth about the biochips implanted in the clones. Through careful investigation, they reveal the chips’ sinister purpose and begin covert removal operations among the 501st and the 212th battalions, ultimately driving Palpatine to accelerate his plans for Order 66. This subplot provides crucial resistance and paves the way for the clones’ loyalty during the final battle.
5. **The Jedi Council and Tradition vs. Change:** Ahsoka and Anakin’s defiance forces the Jedi Council to confront its long-standing policies on attachment, loyalty, and flexibility in Jedi conduct. Tensions arise as the Council issues ultimatums and scrutinizes their actions, while Obi-Wan, Yoda, and even Mace Windu wrestle with these challenges, representing the Council’s internal struggle. By the end, the Council begins a shift toward a more balanced view, influenced by Ahsoka and Anakin’s actions.
6. **Slow-Burn Romance Between Ahsoka and Anakin:** Their evolving feelings serve as an essential subplot, developing gradually from mutual support into an intimate, profound love. Key moments of vulnerability, shared resolve, and self-discovery highlight their romance, which becomes a source of strength and mutual redemption. This arc subtly mirrors the main themes of independence, self-worth, and trust, adding emotional depth to the story.

## Chapters
The chapter outlines for the different arcs.

### Arc 1: Reconnection and Reflection
**Objective:** Reestablish Ahsoka and Anakin’s connection, initiate the emotional and thematic threads around independence and redemption, and set up the biochip subplot with Ahsoka and Rex’s investigation into Fives’ death.

#### Chapter 1: Reunion
Ahsoka returns to find Anakin, initially encountering resistance but eventually reconnecting with him.

| Scenes | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Arrival at the Temple | Ahsoka arrives at the Jedi Temple, asking for Anakin. She faces the guarded bureaucracy of the Jedi but is helped by Obi-Wan and taken by him inside to talk about Anakin's fate. |
| Scene 2 - Discussion with Obi-Wan | Obi-Wan takes Ahsoka back to his chambers and they talk about Anakin's decline after Ahsoka left, his wife Padmé left him and he endangered his troops. She feels responsible and both she and Obi-Wan blame themselves. They also rekindle their relationship somewhat, talking about themselves and what happened to them. Obi-Wan reveals, that he has the current location of Anakin and entrusts her with finding him as he himself does not feel like the right person to do that right now. They hug, he gives her his personal Com-Channel and Ahsoka makes her way to the lower levels. |
| Scene 3 - Journey to the lower Levels | Ahsoka makes her way down and has a run in with a unfriendly warden of the motel Anakin supposedly stays at, ogling and warning her about what she may find, as it sounded like bloody murder from his room last night. She makes her way to his room and enters with the force as nobody opens to her announcements. Fearing what she may find she goes to the living room and opens it. There she finds a Anakin, seemingly broken, drunk and depressed. His robotic arm malfunctioning. Giving her goosebumps at the sight. |
| Scene 4 - First Encounter | Ahsoka cannot believe what she sees and tries to speak to Anakin. At first he does not acknowledge her and asks her to leave. She understands that he thinks she is a hallucination, as he talks about seeing her before and her never being real. He says shes better off without him and that she shouldn't be here. To this Ahsoka breaks into tears and rams into him, hugging him. He recognizes she is real and they cry for a moment together. Ahsoka says she wants to help him, but Anakin is dismissive and doesn't want any help. Ahsoka is left speechless at his stubbornness and his continuing drinking. |

#### Chapter 2: Tension
Ahsoka at a loss of what to do with Anakin has a quick talk with Obi-Wan for help, while Anakin is trapped inside a flashback of what had happened during the incident which moved him to leave the order.

| Scenes | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Clearance of mind | Ahsoka doesn't get further with Anakin, as he does not want to leave or have any help from her or anybody else, closing himself off. She steps outside for a minute to "get some air" telling him, that he cannot blame himself for everything, that he should not punish himself for everything that happened, that he also deserves to heal.  "You were always there for me. You protected everyone—even when it cost you. Don’t you deserve to be helped, too?" As she steps outside she gets ready to call Obi-Wan for some help in the matter. She didn't know what to do, if Anakin wouldn't accept her help. She doesn't know how she would handle that situation. |
| Scene 2 - Flashback | After Ahsoka stepped outside Anakin feels the dread of being alone in the room, feeling it close in on him again. Deserves to heal? not blame himself? But he is responsible. Everything is his fault. At that he enters a flashback of the mission, which was the end of his jedi ways. Padmé had left him and he became sloppier and sloppier, as he went about his missions. Not able to concentrate. Rex asked him if he was alright. He lied as always. Rex persisted: "Are you sure you’re okay?". He can still feel the pang of guilt, as he lied to one of his best friends then. Failing him and denying the others there to be safe. The mission commenced and he can faintly remember someone warning him of a possible trap, but he didn't listen. Everyone died. But Rex, his medic and himself. He feels the crushing guilt as he sits for days at Rex's side. As Rex awakes, he tells him sorry and that he is going to resign. Before Rex can say anything Anakin leaves. In real life Anakin tenses his fists as he has to keep calm enough not to punch the wall again. He felt sick to his stomach. |
| Scene 3 - Obi-Wan’s Support | After leaving Anakin, Ahsoka has a quiet, reflective conversation with Obi-Wan. He subtly encourages her persistence, hinting at his own concerns for Anakin. She tells him of his state and how he refuses to accept her help. Obi-Wan is noticeably disturbed by this news, but helps her calm down, as he talks her through some breathing techniques. For a moment the look in Obi-Wan's eyes changes as he reminisces about the way Anakin used to be, the vibrant, overactive and good person he was. They are silent for a moment, before Obi-Wan can school his emotions again. He tells her, that Anakin is at a place he thinks he deserves. That he will not be easily swayed or helped. That she cannot change the things as they are right this moment. Ahsoka knows he is right, but she doesn't like that. Obi-Wan affirms that he does not like it either. But that Anakin will need her. She tells him, that he is needed as well, to which he just smiles and says that he is needed too, but not right now, not in Anakin's current state. He tells her to keep trying and make Anakin feel that she means it and will not leave. He says: "We were both lucky to have you, Ahsoka. Anakin, especially." She agrees with a smile and the call ends. |
| Scene 4 - Ahsoka's decision | As Ahsoka steps back inside, Anakin is still sitting like she left him; dissociated like when she found him initially. She can feel his tenseness over their bond, but she can also see it in real live as he sweats and clutches the stool he is sitting on. She comes close to him quietly and sits before him, taking his hands in hers, as she can see his eyes become clear and unclouded again. She asks him what he saw. But he refuses, trying to pull his hands away, as the flashes of his master's eyes looking down on him jolt through him the word "unworthy" repeating in his head over and over again. She keeps her hands on his with a little force and makes him look in her eyes questioningly. She looks at him and remembers something, they both went through. She asks him, if he still remembers the time she was kidnapped by trandoshan hunters and he did not cease searching for her, wanting to be there for her. She tells him, that she understands that he will not accept her and her help right away. But that she will stay and look after him, if he wants it or not. Just as he had. She will stay close. |

#### Chapter 3: Cracks in the Armour
Anakin begins opening up to Ahsoka, showing cracks in his defenses as she persists.

| Scenes | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Ahsoka’s Determination | Ahsoka spends the rest of the day around Anakin, refusing to leave. They don't talk much, as Anakin is refusing to acknowledge her more than he has to. He keeps drinking. He can feel Ahsoka's glare at that, but he doesn't budge and she soon relents. She sits around him, walks around meditates and sometimes she even leans against him as she pulls up a chair next to his and just leans at his side. They don't talk, but it feels nice to have her around, even if he wouldn't tell her that, but she can feel it through their bond. In his state, he isn't the best to hide his feelings. She quietly thinks to herself, that she’d never seen him like this, and it tore at her. To lighten the mood, as she cannot longer hold on in this silence, she begins reminiscing about the Clone Wars and what they went through together. They talk about their first mission together, as she was becoming his Padawan on Christophsis. How they used to compete with everything, much to the annoyance of Obi-Wan and sometimes even Rex. The moment they threw Rex off a turret wall. To this Anakin becomes somewhat sombre. Ahsoka feels some sense of hope as Anakin isn't shutting her out completely even through his resistance. |
| Scene 2 - First Signs of Vulnerability | Talking about all of this, results in a moment of vulnerability of Anakin, as he reveals hints of guilt and self-doubt as he talks about having failed Rex and the 501st. To which Ahsoka does not say anything, wanting to let him vent, if he wants to. He instead goes on to also say, that he failed her. She wants to rebuke it, but he stops her. He talks about her leaving the temple and how that made him feel. That he doesn't blame her, but that he felt as if he lost something of himself and he failed her. She says what she felt and talks a bit about the guild she feels and that she also feels the same about having lost a piece of her. They both have a charged silent moment as they look at each other. She still sitting next to him, as their hands slowly come closer to one another again, as are their bodies. Both staring into each others eyes, completely taken in by the other, as they feel all the unsaid being transmitted over their bond, no word needing to be said. Until a sound pulls them back from it. |
| Scene 3 - Padmé’s Presence | Pulled from the moment Anakin groans at the sound, to which Ahsoka asks, what it is. He says that it is his private comlink, which means it only can be Padmé calling him. He continues that after he has left the order and went out of sight, Padmé regularly blows up his comlink and that he really would rather talk to a Hutt's behind, than to her right now and takes a big swig out off his bottle making him cough, to no reaction of help or pity of Ahsoka. She on the other hand feels a strange singe at the mention of Padmé. She feels guilty about leaving Anakin, but Padmé also hurt him. Badly. She left him, her own husband. She cannot explain the destain she feels for a women she had considered her friend before. But she cannot stop herself asking, if she may talk to Padmé. To which Anakin once again chokes on his sip. He coughs and asks her why. To which Ahsoka just gives him a look, which he seems to understand. Without a word he pulls out the comlink from under a pile of dirty clothes and gives it to her, much to her ick and his amusement. She walks into the corridor, closing the door and takes the call. Padmé starts ecstatic, thinking she finally got Ani on the line, but soon realizes that Ahsoka is staring back at her without a word. She begins unbelieving and happy to see Ahsoka again, as Ahsoka battles with different emotions on her own. She feels relieved to see her friend again, but she also feels as if she betrayed her and most importantly Anakin. And is that jealousy she feels. Padmé seems to notice and stops her happy question to ask why she answered Anakin's comlink and where he is. Ahsoka tells her, that he is in the next room, but currently does not want to talk to her. Padmé begins lamenting what she did and that she just wants to know how he is. Ahsoka tells her, that he isn't well right now. Padmé says she feels responsible and never wanted to hurt him like that. Ahsoka snaps that it is not just her fault. But that they cannot undo what was done. As they both come into silence. As Ahsoka battles with her own feelings, Padmé just looks at her with something knowing in her eyes an begins to smile sadly. She says it is good, that Ahsoka is with him now and that that will help, that he’s in good hands with her. She says she really wants to catch up with her too, but that she has not enough time right now. That they maybe can talk later, together with Ani. The pet name sends a jolt to her heart she cannot place, but Ahsoka smiles back and says that she gladly will talk to her and catch up at some point. Which in and of itself is sincere, but she does not mention Anakin. They say they farewells and the call ends, leaving Ahsoka feeling strangely raw and frustrated. She tries to release her emotions to the force, as she has been taught, but cannot quite do it. She feels strangely protective of him, immediately going into fight mode as Padmé called. She also notices a certain feeling of possessiveness on him, which she is unaccustomed to. |
| Scene 4 - Torn feelings | As Ahsoka comes back into the room, Anakin no longer sits on his chair and she panics slightly, before she sees him standing at a small window overlooking the dirty roads outside. She steps next to him and he asks her what Padmé wanted. She tells him, that she wanted to talk to him and that she feels bad about whatever happened between them. Anakin just nods. After a long moment of silence he tells her she should go. Ahsoka begins to rant that, she is not leaving him, a bit of anger flaring as she still feels raw after the call she just had. But Anakin stops her and tells her, that he doesn't mean forever, but that he just needs a moment to think to himself and that she probably should look up Rex. He hesitates for the faintest second before mentioning him, which she notices. Ahsoka stops at that. Rex? Anakin explains, that Rex also was hit by her leaving and that he deserves to feel happy seeing her again. Under his breath he adds, that he deserves it more than himself, which Ahsoka does not catch at the moment. The realization hitting her, that there were other people she held dear and just as much left behind. Some of the guilt returning. She had made the right choice for herself in leaving, but she has left some people in ruins, which she needs to rectify. Still feeling torn about what she just felt with Anakin and Padmé, as well as wanting to meet Rex and Fives, she quickly agrees. Anakin feels a pang at her accepting, even though he proposed it, feeling proven right in his believe that he does not deserve this and also feeling some kind of relieve. Ahsoka sensing some of what he is feeling tells him, that she will only leave, if he will stay here until she returns. Anakin smiles slightly at that and tells her he will. Ahsoka adds, that he also should take a shower. He laughs a bit and nods, before Ahsoka runs into him hugging him tightly. He accepts it eventually and as they part they smile at one another, before Ahsoka tells him they will see each other soon and he agrees. Feeling a bit warmer. Ahsoka leaves the room and returns after a few seconds to Anakin's confusion as she asks with a slight red tinge to her face, where she can find Rex. Which makes Anakin look at her funny before laughing at her making her pout at him, before he tells her, that he has been placed under the chancellors direct orders and is currently stationed at barracks 5 near the senate building. Anakin feeling slightly warm at their interaction. |

#### Chapter 4: The Investigation Begins
Ahsoka reconnects with Rex, and together they begin to investigate Fives’ death.

| Scenes | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Going to the barracks | Ahsoka makes her way to barracks 5 to meet up with Rex and Fives and all the other 501st troopers she had left behind before. She can feel the guilt of it now eating at her, as she remembers all they did together and how she had lived on the battlefield with them for a big part of her adolescent life. Only to leave them behind without as much as a word. She would not let that stand. She hopes that Anakin won't do anything stupid, but she needs some time to let her emotions settle once again anyway. She had felt weird about him and even weirder when Padmé called. She does not know what that means. But she doesn't have much time, before arriving at the barracks with her speeder. She can see platoons marching and personal scurrying around as others scream orders. Machinery be moved and worked on. She cannot help the feeling of home by seeing that, as she breathes in the air filled with fumes and orders. Although everything seems a bit greyer and darker than before. She makes her way closer to where she instantly knows the entrance to be and is soon stopped by some clones stationed there with red markings, who ask her who she is and what she wants. She almost tells them, that she is commander Tano out of habit, but she just says that she is in search of the 501st and especially their captain named Rex. The clones look at one another in surprise but affirm that they cannot let anyone pass, who is not military personal. She says that they just should call Rex then, that he will want to see her, but they are hesitant. The situation seems unresolvable and she is trying to think of a way to get inside, when a voice from behind calls out her name. It is Jesse who stands behind her his eyes unbelieving. She is incredibly happy to see him. Seeing him standing before her returns memories of them joking around during mess, the way he always made sure she had a ration bar, no matter the circumstances. He dismisses the other troopers and without another explanation to them takes her inside. She can see how happy he is to see her, but his training kicks in and before he walks her deeper inside, he asks her why she is her. She says, she wanted to see Rex and the 501st again, after she left them behind like that. He smiles and says, that they never felt like she left them behind. That they all hoped she is well and just wanted to be able to tell her that themselves. This makes Ahsoka feel tears well up, so she just boxes him in the arm and let's him guide her to where the 501st and Rex are. Ahsoka notices his armour and asks how he has become an ARC and congratulates him about it. Jesse is more than delighted that she noticed and tells her about the honour to be nominated to be one, as he never thought he could. They walk and talk like she never left, making her feel happy. |
| Scene 2 - Reuniting with Rex | As they make their way through the barracks Ahsoka is saluted by a lot of 501st soldiers with mentions of "Good to see you commander", "Thought you escaped this hell hole commander! Glad to see you." and much more pleasantries. Ahsoka feels a bit taken aback by that. This much respect is not something she deserves. She asks Jesse why they still call her commander, after she left she has no military rank anymore. Jesse just smiles and explains, that ranks may be something given by the republic, but that to clone they must be earned through respect and that they do not forget easily what was done for them, even if she officially does not hold a rank anymore. Before she can question more, they reach a door. Jesse gestures to it and tells her, that this is the captains office and that he should be there at this time before he winks at her and walks away, shooing away a few watching 501st troopers. Ahsoka feels a little anxious all of a sudden. Like she is somewhere she does not belong anymore. But she breathes in a couple of times before knocking. The rough voice of Rex echoing inside bidding her in. Some people may think, that clones all sound the same, but they do not. Not to Ahsoka and not to Anakin. They are all individual people and hearing his voice, immediately putts a smile on her face. She takes her courage and walks inside. Rex is sitting leaned over papers, his beard a bit more pronounced as it hasn't been shaved for a bit, as is his blond hair. He just asks why they are bothering him, that he made clear only to come at this time in case of an emergency. Ahsoka stifles a chuckle at his antics, knowing exactly that he hates paperwork. She just asks, what about meeting old friends. To which Rex's movements stop and he looks up fast enough to give her whiplash from it. Commander he asks. She smiles and says that it is just Ahsoka now. Rex stands up, his eyes unreadable and walks up to her. She is unsure of what he will do, she wouldn't hold it against him, if he was angry, so she fidgets a bit stuttering that she just came to say sorry and that she can leave if she isn't wanted. But before she can finish, his armour glad arms go around her and he hugs her. She accepts immediately and they share this moment and laugh. Rex is incredibly happy to see her and they talk a bit, before Ahsoka asks where the rest is, that she also wants to see them especially Fives, as he will be flabbergasted seeing her. Rex becomes sombre and without eye contact he tells her, that Fives was killed. She can feel her heart skip a beat at that, as she briefly imagines his face and his voice talking to her, reprimanding her for being more reckless than Hardcase before laughing and tackling her into a bear hug. Breathing heavily, she feels like puking but asks what happened. Rex explains the situation with Tup and Fives and how it ended. Ahsoka cannot believe it. As they grow silent, they share a heartfelt moment, reminiscing and reflecting on what they’ve both lost since the war began. |
| Scene 3 - Examining Fives’ Records | Ahsoka questions Rex, if anything was done after Fives death to get to the bottom of what happened. To which Rex just shrugs and shakes his head. He says that he tried to get something on the way, that he even wrote a grievance report which he tried to push on the higher ups, but he never heard back and anything concerning Fives and what happened has been classified and never again spoken about. Ahsoka cannot believe this and how this can work. Silently she vows to get to the bottom of what happened, that is the least she ows to Fives. Rex explains that someone higher up the chain probably does not want to have them find out something they want to keep hidden, that they block all the access because they rather have them in the dark. He silently curses at them under his breath, which makes Ahsoka look at him in disbelief. He was always somewhat direct, but he would never directly curse or insult the higher ups before. The war has changed him as well she thinks sombrely. Rex continues in saying, that he wanted to look further into it with general Skywalker, but that after he left they were they lost the influence he had over the chancellor and the higher ups, tying his hands. He says he really could use his talent of going around orders and systems right about now, as he did before with him, when it was needed. He didn't say it in a angry or accusing way, there was more sadness in it than anything else. He realized he said something he maybe shouldn't have and wants to rectify it in saying, he didn't mean ill by him and that she probably is confused where he is. But she just shakes her head, telling him, that she knows what happened to Anakin, or at least the gist of it. Rex looks astounded at that. Ahsoka explains, that she wants to rectify her mistake of leaving and cutting everyone out, that she looked for Anakin and found him. Rex can feel his jaw drop at that, as he immediately asks how Anakin is doing, even forgetting his title of general to her surprise. She tells him, that Anakin is not too well and that he blames himself for what happened to Rex and the troops on that mission they went on together and that it was him, who also send her here, to look after Rex. Rex fell silent and she can tell, that he is saddened by this. So he does know where we are. Rex says. This idiot just left without me being able to stop or help him. I knew something wasn't right after he didn't ask me to stand watch anymore for him to talk to Senator Amidala Damn... She never had seen Rex like this and she is astounded that he knew about Padmé. She lays a hand on his shoulder and tells him, that it will be alright, that she will help Anakin and that Rex can too if he wants to. Rex nods. He says since he left, they are under direct control of the chancellor and sit idly by most of the time or are send on short missions. They go silent for a bit, before Ahsoka gets a idea. Wait he may still be able to help us with Fives she says. To which Rex just asks how. She explains that she still knows his security codes and could use them to get access to the confidential material surrounding Fives and that Obi-Wan probably prevented him from being deleted off the network just yet. She all but expects Rex to reprimand her for even suggesting that, but he smiles at her and says they should do it. Quickly Ahsoka nods and uses his station. She inserts a little data stick, to which she only explains to Rex's raised eyebrow, that it is something to make them anonymous in the system, before she logs into the database. He looks at her funny but does not ask further questions, to her relieve, although she knows he will at some point. She enters the codes and they still work. They look through the material. There even is the grievance report Rex had send, which is just labeled as denied, to which he curses again, making Ahsoka giggle. They read through the incident report and how Fives seemingly changed his behavior and became mentally unstable after removing some chip. They also look through his medical records. They read through the notes which have been found of Fives and something which is always recurring is the mentioning of a biochip which Fives believes to be inside the clones heads and even imaging of one of them with notes of the kaminoans describing it as a "behavioral regulator". But reading through all of it, that does not add up. Fives says something different about them and even the reports contradicts itself. |
| Scene 4 - Seeking Medical Assistance | As they think about what they have just discovered and what that could mean for the clones and them, they are at a loss how to continue. There is only this much of information which has been hidden from the public concerning Fives and Tup. They could search further within the system, but both of them quickly dismiss the notion, as there is probably nothing else of worth to find and it would be risky. It already was risky to access these documents and now that they know what is in them, it feels even more dangerous. Ahsoka cannot place her feeling, but she feels a forboding of danger and a darkness connected to this discovery and those chips. They do not mean anything good. Rex suddenly pikes up as he seems to have an idea. Ahsoka looks at him expectedly. Rex says that they maybe cannot do anything with this information alone, but that he knows someone who can. Ahsoka looks at him questioningly. Rex just smiles and without another word walks out his office, leaving her behind somewhat perplexed. She stays seated until a few moments later she can hear a ruckus on the corridor of someone desperately asking Rex why he is pulling him through the barracks like a mad man. Ahsoka knows that voice and force signature and smiles brightly. In walk Rex who pushes Kix before him, who still is protesting until he sees her and immediately falls quiet. He looks at her for a moment, as Rex closes and locks the door. Kix begins with saying, that he thought, that his brothers were joking around again, but that Ahsoka really was here again. Or he also begins to see things he jokes. He smiles at her and salutes saying "Commander! Great seeing you again." She just smiles back and stands up walking over to him laying a hand on his shoulder. Good to be back Kix, she says with a smile. What's with the hair she asks looking at his head. He chuckles slightly and says he is trying something different as he brushes through his short hair. The moment is soon over as he remembers where he is and looks back and forth between Rex and Ahsoka. He asks them why they hauled him here, what the both of them are planing. They quickly give him a rundown on what they found out and what the implications might be, showing him the material, where he took especial interest in the medical documents, reading and viewing them thoroughly. They look at him and ask him if he knows something. He shakes his head and says, that he never heard of such chips and that he doesn't know their purpose. They grow silent pondering, before Kix continues. He says, that it is not impossible that they all would have them, as the Kaminoans could have easily implanted them while they were inside the tubes. He thinks for a moment more before saying. I cannot say what they are or what they are for, without having a look at one of them. If I can study one of them closely, he could tell them more. But to gain access to one, he would have to remove one of them from a clone, if it even exists. They all look at one another for a moment, unsure of what to make of it. Would that even be possible? Rex asks as he looks at Kix. He answers that it would be possible but ultimately risky, as they don't know what it does and if it may effect the clone it was removed from negatively as he hints at what happened to Fives and that that could be something that would also happen to whoever would have the chip removed. Rex gulps as Kix continues to say that it wouldn't be possible anyway. He does not have the right equipment here and even if he had, every use of GAR medical equipment is monitored and he couldn't just use it as he liked, without alerting someone. Ahsoka pikes in that she could probably help with that. Rex and Kix look at her questioningly as she asks them, if they trust her, to which both nod without a moment lost, making her smile. She tells them, that she has contacts in the lower levels, who could organize a place and tools for them to use discreetly, so that they could go about it without anybody noticing, if they manage to sneak out. Rex and Kix look at one another, Kix shrugging his shoulders to which Rex looks at Ahsoka gives his okay. She briefly thinks back to everything that had happened to her, ever since she left the order.Especially meeting the sisters was something so important to her now, which she never would have been able to inside the orders boundaries and rules |
| Scene 5 - Danger of the chips | They stay silent for a moment before Ahsoka says what she thinks. She tells them, that her gut and the force are telling her, that those chips are dangerous and that she vows to help the clones if that is the case, that Fives didn't die in vain, that she is willing to make his sacrifice count. Internally she hesitates just a moment before vowing this, as she wonders what this might unleash and what it might cost her. But she pushes it aside almost immediately, this is more important. The other look at one another for a moment, silently talking, acknowledging her, before they look at her with aw as she ends her speech. She notices and asks what they are looking at. To which Rex says, that the clones usually do not get treated this nicely by Jedi or other Reg's who they work with. Kix nods and adds since General Skywalker left and after you went away, it is somewhat refreshing to have someone care about us again for a change. Ahsoka smiles sadly at that and says that she is sorry, to which both Rex and Kix begin to shake their heads and hands before them, telling her, that that is not what they meant, that she did nothing wrong. Ahsoka just smiles at them and says, that she won't leave them again and that she vows to do anything for them, which is in her might. And that Anakin will do so as well. Kix looks at Rex and he just brushes him off as to tell him "later". Ahsoka does not catch this interaction. I will get us a place and tools and will inform you once I am ready. She says and the others nod. Rex says that he will look into a save way to get their hands on such a chip with Kix, so that no other Fives has to happen. Ahsoka smiles and then stands up and asks them, if they will show her to the rest of the 501st, so she can say her hellos. Rex and Kix nod and walk with her out of the door, not before Ahsoka has removed her chip from Rex's station and deleted the search history and database access. For this moment she will just allow herself to be happy and around some of her friends she made in the GAR. |

#### Chapter 5: Sleepy Planing
Ahsoka tells Anakin about the plan she, Rex and Kix have conducted and asks him to come with her to the lower levels.

| Scenes | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Ahsoka thinks | Ahsoka spend some time with Rex and all the others of the 501st. They talk about all they went through together and the ones they lost along the way. Hardcase, Tup, Dogma, Fives, Echo and so much more who have been lost to the ever strifeling war. Ahsoka can not place the feeling, but this war felt endless to her and so useless in the end. She had talked to the people, seen how they live now that she is no longer part of the Jedi order. What the Jedi should stand for, what they should protect is long since gone. What they remain are warriors and the people see them as such. As also responsible for the war and the plight they experience. She had talked to and met separatists and seen how they live, what they want. And she cannot say that that is wrong. She has seen systems and people who try to stay neutral. Mandalore and their people, their queen and their students. All of this seems so wrong, so out of place, so fake. She cannot place where these thoughts come from, but she knows that something is up and she can feel, that the biochips have something to do with all of this. They are the key to this mystery somehow and she will see it through until they know what is going on. Until Fives death was not as useless as the deaths of all the other clones buried in nameless graves on planets they should have never been on. While she makes her way back to Anakin she thinks about all of this. She had talked to the clones to the 501st and they still seemed like she remembered them, how she remembered her life, but anything else seems and feels different. Walking outside the other clones look different, behave different. More uniform, more strict more life- and joyless. There was a huge amount of gray even when she was part of the GAR, but now all color seems to be sucked from things giving the GAR and the clones this faceless feel to them, it almost has something oppressive to it, but she probably overthinks this. She remembers the light feeling of being with the clones coming up with designs for their armour as each one had ideas to show their individuality, now she can only see standard stripes on other clones. By now it is late into the night, the day laying hard on her shoulders. She had met with Obi-Wan, found Anakin, talked to Padmé, found out about Fives death and met with the 501st. She could use some sleep right about now, but she had promised him to return and she intends to keep that promise. She hasn't sorted through all the strange feelings she had experienced this day yet, but for now this was to much to be asked to do. She compartmentalizes them and pushes them away for the day, she will get nowhere with this now anyway. For a moment she concentrates on the bond she shares with Anakin and to her joy she can feel him. Distant and faint, but she can feel their connection again, where before she was only slightly sure he wasn't dead. |
| Scene 2 - Walk in | Groggily she parks her bike, pays the warden no mind and walks back to Anakin's apartment. There she lets herself in again and without a thought walks into the living room. There she stops dead in her tracks as she sees Anakin stand before her only glad in a towel, looking at her perplexed as he drying off his hair with another smaller towel. She feels her face burn up and spins around fast mumbling an apology for walking in on him, ready to run away. She is halted in her movement as she hears him chuckle behind her. Slowly she turns around again looking at him to see a small smile on his face. There where few genuine ones during the day, so she is happy to see it, but she also has to pout because of it. She asks what is so funny and he tells her, that her antics are quite funny. He continues with saying that they have shared rooms much smaller than this throughout the war in conditions worse and unforgiving, seen the other at their best and worst and through everyday task. So he finds it funny, that she is so flustered by seeing him out of the shower, which she had seen before many many times. He just shakes his head and continues on drying his hair. Ahsoka is a bit perplexed about herself now as she has to agree, this scene is nothing out of the ordinary for them, it is quite normal to be honest. During their time together and on the battlefield they always tried to keep a decorum of decency and privacy, but seeing the other clad in only towels or even less was normal. But this feels somehow different. Seeing Anakin this way is different. She can feel how her face is still hot while she looks him over. She never has noticed how well build he is, how well his muscles move below his skin. Even now, after he has left the order and began treating himself less than nicely he seemed to still be quite fit. "Why does he look different now?" She couldn't place these feelings again, they were new to the other new ones from earlier that day. She could just about stop herself from walking over to him and touching his body, feel his heat and the movement of his biceps as they flex while they move. She feels a strange need. She shakes her head out of these feelings and asks if it is okay if she uses the shower also. Anakin looks at her, his emotionless and tired face from before returned, as he only nods and says that there are enough towels and that he disinfected the whole bathroom before he used it. She looked at him a bit questioningly as he looked away from her. He explained that he never used the bathroom her before and that this room is not expensive enough or placed well enough, so that he would trust in the cleaning. That he does not know what the people before him did in there. Ahsoka gets his meaning as she just nods and turns around to hide her again reddening face. They never had talked about things like that before. Jedi usually did not have to of course. She goes to the shower and closes the door, locking it behind her. She somehow does feel the need to do that. She takes off her clothes, now a bit more modest to before, where she showed off a bit too much for her taste now after a few years. She stepped into the shower and let the hot water run over her tired body as she massaged it a bit, pressing out the stress of the day, as she let her mind become empty in a impromptu meditation, to calm down after the day. Stepping out she notices, that she didn't bring any spare clothes. She is used to wearing the same for a long period of time, but she could use something comfy and new right about now. Inspired by Anakin's choice of clothing after the shower she takes a few of the towels to wrap herself up in. For some reason she feels the need to use one, which only covers herself from her breasts to about the mid of her thighs, which reveals a lot of her shape and skin. She is surprised at herself for wanting his attention in this way, but she pushes it away, not wanting to overthink this. It feels right, she wants him to see. While stopping to think about it, she grabs another one and walks out. |
| Scene 3 - Discussion | As she steps back into the living room, she can see, that Anakin has thrown over a shirt and is wearing some long pants, both issued by the GAR. He does not seem like the type who would buy himself a set of new and fancy clothing after he left the order and the GAR, just grabbing a few packs of clothes and let that be it. She is a bit disappointed but also has to smile a bit at that. He sits on the small couch which also is situated in the room looking up as the door opens. She walks to one of the chairs they sat on before, letting her side face him, as she began drying her legs. She could feel his gaze on her body. Not just looking at her, but letting his gaze roam. She felt a bit giddy about that. She liked it even. While drying she let the towel she wore slip up dangerously high, making more visible than she ever would have and she can feel his eyes on her exposed skin close to her core. She likes the attention, not letting him notice that she knows that he looks. Soon she questions what she is doing though, as she remembers what she wanted to talk about with him. Concerning the plan with Fives and the biochips. Turning her gaze to him, she could see him look away quickly, making her smile. She finished up drying and walked over to him letting herself flop on the couch next to him. They looked at each other, the air somewhat tense again, but she was the first to talk over the silence. She tells him that Rex and the 501st says hi. To which Anakin's face falls and he looks away. She tells him, that Rex misses him and not only he. He still does not look at him and gives no sign of acknowledging it, as she can only guess how he reprimands himself and tells himself that he is not worthy of seeing them again. She lets it rest for now, but she intends to make this right also. Before she opens with, that he didn't tell her that Fives had died. To which Anakin looks at her again apologetic. She doesn't really blame him, but wanted his attention back. She tells him, that it is okay, but that she will not just let his death be in vain. Anakin looks thoughtful at that, before he nods in agreement, saying that Fives and all the clones deserve better who died, but how she intends to do it. She tells him about what she, Rex and Kix had found and talked about, telling him also that she used his codes, to which he chuckles a bit. Saying that he taught her well. He is deep in thought about it as he tells her, that he remembers what Fives had said before he died, but that he never had the time to give it some mind before. Ahsoka tells him, that she can feel something sinister behind it, that it feels like something important, that her gut and the force tell her to investigate it. Anakin looks at her and nods, he admits that he not always trusted in the force, but that if she can feel its will this strongly, she probably should listen to it. She smiles, seeing some of the old Anakin shine through as she continues and tells him of the plan they have come up with and that she had contacts. He raises an eyebrow at that, but does not ask. She tells him that she plans on meeting with someone in the lower levels the next day. He looks away a sombre smile on his face. She continues in saying that she wants him to go with her. At that he looks at her with wide eyes. She says that he cannot just sit here in this room all day long and drink himself to death. And besides he also agreed to honoring Fives death and finding out more about this, so why not join. He seems hesitant. Ahsoka tells him, that he does not have to do much, but that she would feel saver with him around and that she does not intend to leave him alone and behind. He smiles a bit and tells her that he will think about it. His mind still filled with self-doubt as he frowns thinking that she deserves someone better to help her. Ahsoka wants to protest, but after this long day she feels too tired to do so and just agrees. Not intending to let him not come with her. Anakin looks at her and says that she can have the bed if she wants, that he also cleaned it and gave it some new sheets. She thanks him, not wanting to leave now anyway, but asks where he intends to sleep. He just points to the couch, to which Ahsoka looks at him like he is an idiot. Telling him she will not let him sleep on the couch. That the bed would be big enough for the both of them. She didn't think too much about saying that, they have slept in minimal space close to one another before. They both smile at the idea a bit. He does not seem to think anything by it as he just silently agrees, seeming as tired as she feels somehow. So she also ignores the strange feelings which come up in her belly once again. |
| Scene 4 - Good night | They walk to the bedroom so they can have a look and the bed is generously big they notice, so there really is no problem in sharing. But as Ahsoka looks down at herself she notices a big lack in clothing. A bit red again she turns to Anakin who looks at her and seems to understand what she is thinking. He walks to something looking like a travel backpack and pulls out a shirt and some boxer shorts as well as another of the long pants he is also wearing giving it to her saying that she can have those, that he "borrowed" enough from the GAR to keep him clothed for a few years she just smiles as she walks into the bathroom, quickly changing into it. The boxer shorts fit well enough but both the shirt and pants are too long for her petite small form. The shirt covers her bum and the shorts almost completely and the pants are too long to walk in, so she just leaves them off. Like this she walks into the bedroom again, feeling Anakin's gaze on her once more for a mere moment, as she notices how her getup looks. But she does not feel embarrassed anymore. Maybe she is too tired but she also likes his attention on her. He already sits on one side of the bed, so she makes her way to the other side. without another word spoke they both lay on their respective side and turn of the lights. Only their breathing can be heard in the small room. Anakin says with a tired voice "Night Snips" and she answers "Night Skyguy". As she feels sleep already tugging at her eyelids and drifts off. In the night she awakes to weird noises. She notices that Anakin is churning a bit in his sleep, mumbling things. She can feel his tenseness over their bond. He seems to have a nightmare. She briefly debates if she should wake him, but decides against it, in favor of him getting a much needed full nights sleep Under the blanket they share she reaches out her hand and finds his, clasping it. It presses back and she sends some calming energy over their bond, stopping his churning and mumbling, soliciting a relieved sigh from him. She smiles and slowly drifts off to sleep again too. Their hands still intertwined, his big hand warm and comforting. She thinks of all the fears of failure and not being enough of a Jedi which Anakin had helped her with in the past and dissipated with her. She could feel how both of them have changed as she fell asleep again with a sad smile. |
