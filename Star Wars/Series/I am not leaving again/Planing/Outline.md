## Theme and Concept

| Main Theme |
| :------- |
| The story explores redemption and self-discovery for Ahsoka and Anakin, with each of them facing the consequences of past choices and discovering their own paths forward. It’s about finding inner peace and healing through relationships, challenging institutional beliefs of the republic and the jedi order, and discovering self-worth and autonomy in the face of regret and societal expectations. |

| Secondary Theme |
| :------- |
| This theme plays out through Ahsoka’s struggle for independence and Anakin’s need for acceptance and love. Their contrasting experiences with attachment — Ahsoka’s desire to help without losing herself, and Anakin’s journey to not define his worth through others’ expectations — highlight the importance of balancing love with personal identity. |

| Concept |
| :------- |
| In a galaxy on the brink of war, Ahsoka and Anakin reunite at their lowest, each bearing unresolved guilt and wounded loyalty. Together, they strive to heal and rediscover their purpose, testing their bond in the face of personal redemption, galactic upheaval, and the looming shadow of the Jedi Order’s fall. |

## Story Arcs
The story will have three main arcs, which let Anakin and Ahsoka progress through their journey of discovery and love, while different sub-plots start and culminate around them into the climax at the end of Arc 3

### Arc 1: Reconnection and Reflection
The story begins with Ahsoka’s return, her initial goal being to pull Anakin out of his despair and help him heal. However, as they reconnect, Ahsoka must also confront her own unresolved feelings of guilt and independence.

| Uncovering the Biochips | During their investigation, Ahsoka and Rex find records of the "inhibitor chips" in clone cadets’ medical files. With mounting evidence and Fives’ warnings, they grow suspicious of the chips’ true purpose. Rex agrees to undergo a delicate procedure to remove his chip, trusting Ahsoka’s intuition. |

| Key Plot Points | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Palpatine’s Manipulations | Palpatine, realizing he can no longer use Padmé as leverage over Anakin, subtly shifts his influence toward Ahsoka. He manipulates events to heighten Ahsoka’s frustration with the Order, hoping her connection to Anakin will bring him closer to the Dark Side. |
| Romantic Development | Anakin and Ahsoka’s feelings for each other deepen as they support one another, sharing moments of vulnerability and strength. This subplot should evolve slowly, with small gestures and intimate conversations building up to a shared realization of their feelings. |
| Secret Operations | Rex and Ahsoka work discreetly with medical personnel they trust to remove chips from members of the 501st. They must act in secrecy, as questioning these chips could lead to conflict with Jedi leadership or even the Chancellor’s office. |

| Anakin continues grappling with his self-worth, slowly learning to accept love and support without feeling unworthy. He’s haunted by his past but grows to realize that he doesn’t have to face it alone. |

| Pressure from Palpatine |
| :------- |
| Palpatine begins to notice changes within the clone forces, as members of the 501st and 212th begin to act more independently and show unexpected defiance. Sensing a threat to his plan, he increases his influence over the Jedi Council and tries to speed up his timeline, setting up the confrontation sooner than anticipated. |

| Climax of Arc 2 |
| :------- |
| Palpatine’s manipulations come to a head, and Ahsoka and Anakin stand up to the Council in a pivotal confrontation. They question the Jedi’s unyielding stance on attachment and are nearly expelled. However, they gain the quiet support of key figures like Obi-Wan, Rex, and even Yoda, who begins to understand the Order’s failures. |

### Arc 3: Redemption and Revolution
As tensions escalate in the galaxy, Ahsoka and Anakin fight to protect the Jedi Order from itself and from Palpatine’s corruption. The romance reaches its culmination, and they’re faced with the ultimate test of their loyalty to each other, their friends, and the Jedi. Order 66 looms, and they must act to prevent it from unfolding.

| Key Plot Points | |

| The Chancellor’s Deception | As Ahsoka, Anakin, Obi-Wan, Rex, and Cody connect the dots, they start to suspect that Palpatine may be orchestrating a larger scheme, including a sinister use for the biochips. They work in the shadows, preparing the clones who’ve removed their chips and strengthening their resistance against Palpatine’s control. |
| Obi-Wan and Yoda’s Realization | Seeing Ahsoka and Anakin’s defiance, both Obi-Wan and Yoda finally recognize the Jedi Order’s mistakes, leading to a climactic moment where they openly support Ahsoka and Anakin’s resistance against Palpatine. |
| Preventing Order 66 | When Palpatine finally executes Order 66, parts of the 501st and 212th who had their chips removed are able to resist. Rex and Cody rally their brothers, convincing them to turn against the Chancellor’s forces and support the Jedi instead. |
| The Showdown with Palpatine | The story culminates in an intense showdown where Ahsoka, Anakin, and their allies fight Palpatine and his loyalists. Here, Palpatine tries one last time to turn Anakin by manipulating his self-doubt and tempting him with power. Anakin’s acceptance of himself and Ahsoka’s support allows him to resist. |

| Ahsoka’s Growth |
| :------- |
| Ahsoka embraces her autonomy fully, realizing she can love and still remain true to herself. She’s become a leader, her defiance of the Council now validated as a new path forward for the Jedi. |

| Anakin’s Growth |
| :------- |
| Anakin achieves self-acceptance, rejecting Palpatine’s temptations and seeing himself as worthy of love and redemption. His transformation symbolizes a new vision for what the Jedi could be. |

| Climactic Battle |
| :------- |
| With the resistance of the 501st, the 212th, and their Jedi allies, Ahsoka, Anakin, and Obi-Wan lead a direct assault on Palpatine. They work together to dismantle his hold over the Republic, exposing him as the Sith mastermind and preventing him from decimating the Jedi through Order 66.
 |

| Resolution |
| :------- |
| After Palpatine’s defeat, the Jedi Order faces a reckoning. Thanks to the influence of Ahsoka, Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Yoda, they begin to reform, embracing a more compassionate and flexible approach to attachment and emotions. |

### Slow-Burn Romance Development

- **Arc 1:** Ahsoka and Anakin begin rediscovering their bond as friends, with subtle hints of romantic tension.
- **Arc 2:** They face moments of vulnerability, moving closer through shared experiences and emotional support.
- **Arc 3:** Their feelings culminate in open confession and mutual acceptance, transforming their relationship into a source of strength for the climax.

## Supporting Subplots and Characters

1. **Obi-Wan’s Arc:** Obi-Wan’s evolving views on the Jedi Order parallel the primary arcs. He begins to question the Order’s rigid stance on attachment and emotion, gradually becoming an ally in the movement for change and ultimately defending Ahsoka and Anakin’s unconventional approaches.
2. **Rex and the 501st:** Rex’s loyalty and friendship become crucial as he assists Ahsoka and Anakin in their investigation and resistance against Palpatine. His role as a leader in the 501st and his decision to remove the biochip from himself (and later, from his troops) highlight the importance of trust and chosen bonds, which transcend traditional Jedi teachings.
3. **Padmé’s Influence:** Padmé’s presence complicates the budding romance, causing Ahsoka to confront feelings of jealousy and doubt while reminding Anakin of his past attachments. Over time, Padmé’s perspective shifts, and she comes to accept Ahsoka’s role in Anakin’s life, allowing Anakin and Ahsoka’s relationship to deepen without lingering guilt or unresolved feelings.
4. **Biochip Investigation:** Sparked by the suspicious death of Fives, Ahsoka and Rex embark on a journey to uncover the truth about the biochips implanted in the clones. Through careful investigation, they reveal the chips’ sinister purpose and begin covert removal operations among the 501st and the 212th battalions, ultimately driving Palpatine to accelerate his plans for Order 66. This subplot provides crucial resistance and paves the way for the clones’ loyalty during the final battle.
5. **The Jedi Council and Tradition vs. Change:** Ahsoka and Anakin’s defiance forces the Jedi Council to confront its long-standing policies on attachment, loyalty, and flexibility in Jedi conduct. Tensions arise as the Council issues ultimatums and scrutinizes their actions, while Obi-Wan, Yoda, and even Mace Windu wrestle with these challenges, representing the Council’s internal struggle. By the end, the Council begins a shift toward a more balanced view, influenced by Ahsoka and Anakin’s actions.
6. **Slow-Burn Romance Between Ahsoka and Anakin:** Their evolving feelings serve as an essential subplot, developing gradually from mutual support into an intimate, profound love. Key moments of vulnerability, shared resolve, and self-discovery highlight their romance, which becomes a source of strength and mutual redemption. This arc subtly mirrors the main themes of independence, self-worth, and trust, adding emotional depth to the story.

## Chapters
The chapter outlines for the different arcs.

### Arc 1: Reconnection and Reflection
**Objective:** Reestablish Ahsoka and Anakin’s connection, initiate the emotional and thematic threads around independence and redemption, and set up the biochip subplot with Ahsoka and Rex’s investigation into Fives’ death.

#### Chapter 1: Reunion
Ahsoka returns to find Anakin, initially encountering resistance but eventually reconnecting with him.

| Scenes | Description |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Arrival at the Temple | Ahsoka arrives at the Jedi Temple, asking for Anakin. She faces the guarded bureaucracy of the Jedi but is helped by Obi-Wan and taken by him inside to talk about Anakin's fate. |
| Scene 2 - Discussion with Obi-Wan | Obi-Wan takes Ahsoka back to his chambers and they talk about Anakin's decline after Ahsoka left, his wife Padmé left him and he endangered his troops. She feels responsible and both she and Obi-Wan blame themselves. They also rekindle their relationship somewhat, talking about themselves and what happened to them. Obi-Wan reveals, that he has the current location of Anakin and entrusts her with finding him as he himself does not feel like the right person to do that right now. They hug, he gives her his personal Com-Channel and Ahsoka makes her way to the lower levels. |
| Scene 3 - Journey to the lower Levels | Ahsoka makes her way down and has a run in with a unfriendly warden of the motel Anakin supposedly stays at, ogling and warning her about what she may find, as it sounded like bloody murder from his room last night. She makes her way to his room and enters with the force as nobody opens to her announcements. Fearing what she may find she goes to the living room and opens it. There she finds a Anakin, seemingly broken, drunk and depressed. His robotic arm malfunctioning. Giving her goosebumps at the sight. |
| Scene 4 - First Encounter | Ahsoka cannot believe what she sees and tries to speak to Anakin. At first he does not acknowledge her and asks her to leave. She understands that he thinks she is a hallucination, as he talks about seeing her before and her never being real. He says shes better off without him and that she shouldn't be here. To this Ahsoka breaks into tears and rams into him, hugging him. He recognizes she is real and they cry for a moment together. Ahsoka says she wants to help him, but Anakin is dismissive and doesn't want any help. Ahsoka is left speechless at his stubbornness and his continuing drinking. |

#### Chapter 2: Tension
Ahsoka at a loss of what to do with Anakin has a quick talk with Obi-Wan for help, while Anakin is trapped inside a flashback of what had happened during the incident which moved him to leave the order.

| Scenes | Description |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Clearance of mind | Ahsoka doesn't get further with Anakin, as he does not want to leave or have any help from her or anybody else, closing himself off. She steps outside for a minute to "get some air" telling him, that he cannot blame himself for everything, that he should not punish himself for everything that happened, that he also deserves to heal.  "You were always there for me. You protected everyone—even when it cost you. Don’t you deserve to be helped, too?" As she steps outside she gets ready to call Obi-Wan for some help in the matter. She didn't know what to do, if Anakin wouldn't accept her help. She doesn't know how she would handle that situation. |
| Scene 2 - Flashback | After Ahsoka stepped outside Anakin feels the dread of being alone in the room, feeling it close in on him again. Deserves to heal? not blame himself? But he is responsible. Everything is his fault. At that he enters a flashback of the mission, which was the end of his jedi ways. Padmé had left him and he became sloppier and sloppier, as he went about his missions. Not able to concentrate. Rex asked him if he was alright. He lied as always. Rex persisted: "Are you sure you’re okay?". He can still feel the pang of guilt, as he lied to one of his best friends then. Failing him and denying the others there to be safe. The mission commenced and he can faintly remember someone warning him of a possible trap, but he didn't listen. Everyone died. But Rex, his medic and himself. He feels the crushing guilt as he sits for days at Rex's side. As Rex awakes, he tells him sorry and that he is going to resign. Before Rex can say anything Anakin leaves. In real life Anakin tenses his fists as he has to keep calm enough not to punch the wall again. He felt sick to his stomach. |
| Scene 3 - Obi-Wan’s Support | After leaving Anakin, Ahsoka has a quiet, reflective conversation with Obi-Wan. He subtly encourages her persistence, hinting at his own concerns for Anakin. She tells him of his state and how he refuses to accept her help. Obi-Wan is noticeably disturbed by this news, but helps her calm down, as he talks her through some breathing techniques. For a moment the look in Obi-Wan's eyes changes as he reminisces about the way Anakin used to be, the vibrant, overactive and good person he was. They are silent for a moment, before Obi-Wan can school his emotions again. He tells her, that Anakin is at a place he thinks he deserves. That he will not be easily swayed or helped. That she cannot change the things as they are right this moment. Ahsoka knows he is right, but she doesn't like that. Obi-Wan affirms that he does not like it either. But that Anakin will need her. She tells him, that he is needed as well, to which he just smiles and says that he is needed too, but not right now, not in Anakin's current state. He tells her to keep trying and make Anakin feel that she means it and will not leave. He says: "We were both lucky to have you, Ahsoka. Anakin, especially." She agrees with a smile and the call ends. |
| Scene 4 - Ahsoka's decision | As Ahsoka steps back inside, Anakin is still sitting like she left him; dissociated like when she found him initially. She can feel his tenseness over their bond, but she can also see it in real live as he sweats and clutches the stool he is sitting on. She comes close to him quietly and sits before him, taking his hands in hers, as she can see his eyes become clear and unclouded again. She asks him what he saw. But he refuses, trying to pull his hands away, as the flashes of his master's eyes looking down on him jolt through him the word "unworthy" repeating in his head over and over again. She keeps her hands on his with a little force and makes him look in her eyes questioningly. She looks at him and remembers something, they both went through. She asks him, if he still remembers the time she was kidnapped by trandoshan hunters and he did not cease searching for her, wanting to be there for her. She tells him, that she understands that he will not accept her and her help right away. But that she will stay and look after him, if he wants it or not. Just as he had. She will stay close. |

#### Chapter 3: Cracks in the Armour
Anakin begins opening up to Ahsoka, showing cracks in his defenses as she persists.

| Scenes | Description |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Ahsoka’s Determination | Ahsoka spends the rest of the day around Anakin, refusing to leave. They don't talk much, as Anakin is refusing to acknowledge her more than he has to. He keeps drinking. He can feel Ahsoka's glare at that, but he doesn't budge and she soon relents. She sits around him, walks around meditates and sometimes she even leans against him as she pulls up a chair next to his and just leans at his side. They don't talk, but it feels nice to have her around, even if he wouldn't tell her that, but she can feel it through their bond. In his state, he isn't the best to hide his feelings. She quietly thinks to herself, that she’d never seen him like this, and it tore at her. To lighten the mood, as she cannot longer hold on in this silence, she begins reminiscing about the Clone Wars and what they went through together. They talk about their first mission together, as she was becoming his Padawan on Christophsis. How they used to compete with everything, much to the annoyance of Obi-Wan and sometimes even Rex. The moment they threw Rex off a turret wall. To this Anakin becomes somewhat sombre. Ahsoka feels some sense of hope as Anakin isn't shutting her out completely even through his resistance. |
| Scene 2 - First Signs of Vulnerability | Talking about all of this, results in a moment of vulnerability of Anakin, as he reveals hints of guilt and self-doubt as he talks about having failed Rex and the 501st. To which Ahsoka does not say anything, wanting to let him vent, if he wants to. He instead goes on to also say, that he failed her. She wants to rebuke it, but he stops her. He talks about her leaving the temple and how that made him feel. That he doesn't blame her, but that he felt as if he lost something of himself and he failed her. She says what she felt and talks a bit about the guild she feels and that she also feels the same about having lost a piece of her. They both have a charged silent moment as they look at each other. She still sitting next to him, as their hands slowly come closer to one another again, as are their bodies. Both staring into each others eyes, completely taken in by the other, as they feel all the unsaid being transmitted over their bond, no word needing to be said. Until a sound pulls them back from it. |
| Scene 3 - Padmé’s Presence | Pulled from the moment Anakin groans at the sound, to which Ahsoka asks, what it is. He says that it is his private comlink, which means it only can be Padmé calling him. He continues that after he has left the order and went out of sight, Padmé regularly blows up his comlink and that he really would rather talk to a Hutt's behind, than to her right now and takes a big swig out off his bottle making him cough, to no reaction of help or pity of Ahsoka. She on the other hand feels a strange singe at the mention of Padmé. She feels guilty about leaving Anakin, but Padmé also hurt him. Badly. She left him, her own husband. She cannot explain the destain she feels for a women she had considered her friend before. But she cannot stop herself asking, if she may talk to Padmé. To which Anakin once again chokes on his sip. He coughs and asks her why. To which Ahsoka just gives him a look, which he seems to understand. Without a word he pulls out the comlink from under a pile of dirty clothes and gives it to her, much to her ick and his amusement. She walks into the corridor, closing the door and takes the call. Padmé starts ecstatic, thinking she finally got Ani on the line, but soon realizes that Ahsoka is staring back at her without a word. She begins unbelieving and happy to see Ahsoka again, as Ahsoka battles with different emotions on her own. She feels relieved to see her friend again, but she also feels as if she betrayed her and most importantly Anakin. And is that jealousy she feels. Padmé seems to notice and stops her happy question to ask why she answered Anakin's comlink and where he is. Ahsoka tells her, that he is in the next room, but currently does not want to talk to her. Padmé begins lamenting what she did and that she just wants to know how he is. Ahsoka tells her, that he isn't well right now. Padmé says she feels responsible and never wanted to hurt him like that. Ahsoka snaps that it is not just her fault. But that they cannot undo what was done. As they both come into silence. As Ahsoka battles with her own feelings, Padmé just looks at her with something knowing in her eyes an begins to smile sadly. She says it is good, that Ahsoka is with him now and that that will help, that he’s in good hands with her. She says she really wants to catch up with her too, but that she has not enough time right now. That they maybe can talk later, together with Ani. The pet name sends a jolt to her heart she cannot place, but Ahsoka smiles back and says that she gladly will talk to her and catch up at some point. Which in and of itself is sincere, but she does not mention Anakin. They say they farewells and the call ends, leaving Ahsoka feeling strangely raw and frustrated. She tries to release her emotions to the force, as she has been taught, but cannot quite do it. She feels strangely protective of him, immediately going into fight mode as Padmé called. She also notices a certain feeling of possessiveness on him, which she is unaccustomed to. |
| Scene 4 - Torn feelings | As Ahsoka comes back into the room, Anakin no longer sits on his chair and she panics slightly, before she sees him standing at a small window overlooking the dirty roads outside. She steps next to him and he asks her what Padmé wanted. She tells him, that she wanted to talk to him and that she feels bad about whatever happened between them. Anakin just nods. After a long moment of silence he tells her she should go. Ahsoka begins to rant that, she is not leaving him, a bit of anger flaring as she still feels raw after the call she just had. But Anakin stops her and tells her, that he doesn't mean forever, but that he just needs a moment to think to himself and that she probably should look up Rex. He hesitates for the faintest second before mentioning him, which she notices. Ahsoka stops at that. Rex? Anakin explains, that Rex also was hit by her leaving and that he deserves to feel happy seeing her again. Under his breath he adds, that he deserves it more than himself, which Ahsoka does not catch at the moment. The realization hitting her, that there were other people she held dear and just as much left behind. Some of the guilt returning. She had made the right choice for herself in leaving, but she has left some people in ruins, which she needs to rectify. Still feeling torn about what she just felt with Anakin and Padmé, as well as wanting to meet Rex and Fives, she quickly agrees. Anakin feels a pang at her accepting, even though he proposed it, feeling proven right in his believe that he does not deserve this and also feeling some kind of relieve. Ahsoka sensing some of what he is feeling tells him, that she will only leave, if he will stay here until she returns. Anakin smiles slightly at that and tells her he will. Ahsoka adds, that he also should take a shower. He laughs a bit and nods, before Ahsoka runs into him hugging him tightly. He accepts it eventually and as they part they smile at one another, before Ahsoka tells him they will see each other soon and he agrees. Feeling a bit warmer. Ahsoka leaves the room and returns after a few seconds to Anakin's confusion as she asks with a slight red tinge to her face, where she can find Rex. Which makes Anakin look at her funny before laughing at her making her pout at him, before he tells her, that he has been placed under the chancellors direct orders and is currently stationed at barracks 5 near the senate building. Anakin feeling slightly warm at their interaction. |

#### Chapter 4: The Investigation Begins
Ahsoka reconnects with Rex, and together they begin to investigate Fives’ death.

| Scenes | Description |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Going to the barracks | Ahsoka makes her way to barracks 5 to meet up with Rex and Fives and all the other 501st troopers she had left behind before. She can feel the guilt of it now eating at her, as she remembers all they did together and how she had lived on the battlefield with them for a big part of her adolescent life. Only to leave them behind without as much as a word. She would not let that stand. She hopes that Anakin won't do anything stupid, but she needs some time to let her emotions settle once again anyway. She had felt weird about him and even weirder when Padmé called. She does not know what that means. But she doesn't have much time, before arriving at the barracks with her speeder. She can see platoons marching and personal scurrying around as others scream orders. Machinery be moved and worked on. She cannot help the feeling of home by seeing that, as she breathes in the air filled with fumes and orders. Although everything seems a bit greyer and darker than before. She makes her way closer to where she instantly knows the entrance to be and is soon stopped by some clones stationed there with red markings, who ask her who she is and what she wants. She almost tells them, that she is commander Tano out of habit, but she just says that she is in search of the 501st and especially their captain named Rex. The clones look at one another in surprise but affirm that they cannot let anyone pass, who is not military personal. She says that they just should call Rex then, that he will want to see her, but they are hesitant. The situation seems unresolvable and she is trying to think of a way to get inside, when a voice from behind calls out her name. It is Jesse who stands behind her his eyes unbelieving. She is incredibly happy to see him. Seeing him standing before her returns memories of them joking around during mess, the way he always made sure she had a ration bar, no matter the circumstances. He dismisses the other troopers and without another explanation to them takes her inside. She can see how happy he is to see her, but his training kicks in and before he walks her deeper inside, he asks her why she is her. She says, she wanted to see Rex and the 501st again, after she left them behind like that. He smiles and says, that they never felt like she left them behind. That they all hoped she is well and just wanted to be able to tell her that themselves. This makes Ahsoka feel tears well up, so she just boxes him in the arm and let's him guide her to where the 501st and Rex are. Ahsoka notices his armour and asks how he has become an ARC and congratulates him about it. Jesse is more than delighted that she noticed and tells her about the honour to be nominated to be one, as he never thought he could. They walk and talk like she never left, making her feel happy. |
| Scene 2 - Reuniting with Rex | As they make their way through the barracks Ahsoka is saluted by a lot of 501st soldiers with mentions of "Good to see you commander", "Thought you escaped this hell hole commander! Glad to see you." and much more pleasantries. Ahsoka feels a bit taken aback by that. This much respect is not something she deserves. She asks Jesse why they still call her commander, after she left she has no military rank anymore. Jesse just smiles and explains, that ranks may be something given by the republic, but that to clone they must be earned through respect and that they do not forget easily what was done for them, even if she officially does not hold a rank anymore. Before she can question more, they reach a door. Jesse gestures to it and tells her, that this is the captains office and that he should be there at this time before he winks at her and walks away, shooing away a few watching 501st troopers. Ahsoka feels a little anxious all of a sudden. Like she is somewhere she does not belong anymore. But she breathes in a couple of times before knocking. The rough voice of Rex echoing inside bidding her in. Some people may think, that clones all sound the same, but they do not. Not to Ahsoka and not to Anakin. They are all individual people and hearing his voice, immediately putts a smile on her face. She takes her courage and walks inside. Rex is sitting leaned over papers, his beard a bit more pronounced as it hasn't been shaved for a bit, as is his blond hair. He just asks why they are bothering him, that he made clear only to come at this time in case of an emergency. Ahsoka stifles a chuckle at his antics, knowing exactly that he hates paperwork. She just asks, what about meeting old friends. To which Rex's movements stop and he looks up fast enough to give her whiplash from it. Commander he asks. She smiles and says that it is just Ahsoka now. Rex stands up, his eyes unreadable and walks up to her. She is unsure of what he will do, she wouldn't hold it against him, if he was angry, so she fidgets a bit stuttering that she just came to say sorry and that she can leave if she isn't wanted. But before she can finish, his armour glad arms go around her and he hugs her. She accepts immediately and they share this moment and laugh. Rex is incredibly happy to see her and they talk a bit, before Ahsoka asks where the rest is, that she also wants to see them especially Fives, as he will be flabbergasted seeing her. Rex becomes sombre and without eye contact he tells her, that Fives has died. She can feel her heart skip a beat at that, as she briefly imagines his face and his voice talking to her, reprimanding her for being more reckless than Hardcase before laughing and tackling her into a bear hug. Breathing heavily, she feels like puking but asks what happened. Rex explains the situation with Tup and Fives and how it ended. Ahsoka cannot believe it. As they grow silent, they share a heartfelt moment, reminiscing and reflecting on what they’ve both lost since the war began. |
| Scene 3 - Examining Fives’ Records | Ahsoka questions Rex, if anything was done after Fives death to get to the bottom of what happened, if what he said was true or if he really had lost his mind. To which Rex just shrugs and shakes his head. He says that he tried to get something on the way, that he even wrote a grievance report which he tried to push on the higher ups, but he never heard back and anything concerning Fives and what happened has been classified and never again spoken about. Ahsoka cannot believe this and how this can work. Silently she vows to get to the bottom of what happened, that is the least she ows to Fives. Rex explains that someone higher up the chain probably does not want to have them find out something they want to keep hidden, that they block all the access because they rather have them in the dark. He silently curses at them under his breath, which makes Ahsoka look at him in disbelief. He was always somewhat direct, but he would never directly curse or insult the higher ups before. The war has changed him as well she thinks sombrely. Rex continues in saying, that he wanted to look further into it with general Skywalker, but that after he left they were they lost the influence he had over the chancellor and the higher ups, tying his hands. He says he really could use his talent of going around orders and systems right about now, as he did before with him, when it was needed. That he and general Skywalker failed Fives. He didn't say it in a angry or accusing way, there was more sadness in it than anything else. He realized he said something he maybe shouldn't have and wants to rectify it in saying, he didn't mean ill by him and that she probably is confused where he is. But she just shakes her head, telling him, that she knows what happened to Anakin, or at least the gist of it. Rex looks astounded at that. Ahsoka explains, that she wants to rectify her mistake of leaving and cutting everyone out, that she looked for Anakin and found him. Rex can feel his jaw drop at that, as he immediately asks how Anakin is doing, even forgetting his title of general to her surprise. She tells him, that Anakin is not too well and that he blames himself for what happened to Rex and the troops on that mission they went on together and that it was him, who also send her here, to look after Rex. Rex fell silent and she can tell, that he is saddened by this. So he does know where we are. Rex says. This idiot just left without me being able to stop or help him. I knew something wasn't right after he didn't ask me to stand watch anymore for him to talk to Senator Amidala Damn... She never had seen Rex like this and she is astounded that he knew about Padmé. She lays a hand on his shoulder and tells him, that it will be alright, that she will help Anakin and that Rex can too if he wants to. Rex nods. He says since he left, they are under direct control of the chancellor and sit idly by most of the time or are send on short missions. They go silent for a bit, before Ahsoka gets a idea. Wait he may still be able to help us with Fives she says. To which Rex just asks how. She explains that she still knows his security codes and could use them to get access to the confidential material surrounding Fives and that Obi-Wan probably prevented him from being deleted off the network just yet. She all but expects Rex to reprimand her for even suggesting that, but he smiles at her and says they should do it. Quickly Ahsoka nods and uses his station. She inserts a little data stick, to which she only explains to Rex's raised eyebrow, that it is something to make them anonymous in the system, before she logs into the database. He looks at her funny but does not ask further questions, to her relieve, although she knows he will at some point. She enters the codes and they still work. They look through the material. There even is the grievance report Rex had send, which is just labeled as denied, to which he curses again, making Ahsoka giggle. They read through the incident report and how Fives seemingly changed his behavior and became mentally unstable after removing some chip. They also look through his medical records. They read through the notes which have been found of Fives and something which is always recurring is the mentioning of a biochip which Fives believes to be inside the clones heads and even imaging of one of them with notes of the kaminoans describing it as a "behavioral regulator" which in his case has been affected by a virus of some sort. But reading through all of it, that does not add up. Fives says something different about them and even the reports contradict themselves. The testimony of the chancellor of how Fives attacked him, feels wrong in a way too. |
| Scene 4 - Seeking Medical Assistance | As they think about what they have just discovered and what that could mean for the clones and them, they are at a loss how to continue. There is only this much of information which has been hidden from the public concerning Fives and Tup. They could search further within the system, but both of them quickly dismiss the notion, as there is probably nothing else of worth to find and it would be risky. It already was risky to access these documents and now that they know what is in them, it feels even more dangerous. Ahsoka cannot place her feeling, but she feels a forboding of danger and a darkness connected to this discovery and those chips. They do not mean anything good. Rex suddenly pikes up as he seems to have an idea. Ahsoka looks at him expectedly. Rex says that they maybe cannot do anything with this information alone, but that he knows someone who can. Ahsoka looks at him questioningly. Rex just smiles and without another word walks out his office, leaving her behind somewhat perplexed. She stays seated until a few moments later she can hear a ruckus on the corridor of someone desperately asking Rex why he is pulling him through the barracks like a mad man. Ahsoka knows that voice and force signature and smiles brightly. In walk Rex who pushes Kix before him, who still is protesting until he sees her and immediately falls quiet. He looks at her for a moment, as Rex closes and locks the door. Kix begins with saying, that he thought, that his brothers were joking around again, but that Ahsoka really was here again. Or he also begins to see things he jokes. He smiles at her and salutes saying "Commander! Great seeing you again." She just smiles back and stands up walking over to him laying a hand on his shoulder. Good to be back Kix, she says with a smile. What's with the hair she asks looking at his head. He chuckles slightly and says he is trying something different as he brushes through his short hair. The moment is soon over as he remembers where he is and looks back and forth between Rex and Ahsoka. He asks them why they hauled him here, what the both of them are planing. They quickly give him a rundown on what they found out and what the implications might be, showing him the material, where he took especial interest in the medical documents, reading and viewing them thoroughly. They look at him and ask him if he knows something. He shakes his head and says, that he never heard of such chips and that he doesn't know their purpose. They grow silent pondering, before Kix continues. He says, that it is not impossible that they all would have them, as the Kaminoans could have easily implanted them while they were inside the tubes. He thinks for a moment more before saying. I cannot say what they are or what they are for, without having a look at one of them. If I can study one of them closely, he could tell them more. But to gain access to one, he would have to remove one of them from a clone, if it even exists. They all look at one another for a moment, unsure of what to make of it. Would that even be possible? Rex asks as he looks at Kix. He answers that it would be possible but ultimately risky, as they don't know what it does and if it may effect the clone it was removed from negatively as he hints at what happened to Fives and that that could be something that would also happen to whoever would have the chip removed. Rex gulps as Kix continues to say that it wouldn't be possible anyway. He does not have the right equipment here and even if he had, every use of GAR medical equipment is monitored and he couldn't just use it as he liked, without alerting someone. Ahsoka pikes in that she could probably help with that. Rex and Kix look at her questioningly as she asks them, if they trust her, to which both nod without a moment lost, making her smile. She tells them, that she has contacts in the lower levels, who could organize a place and tools for them to use discreetly, so that they could go about it without anybody noticing, if they manage to sneak out. Rex and Kix look at one another, Kix shrugging his shoulders to which Rex looks at Ahsoka gives his okay. She briefly thinks back to everything that had happened to her, ever since she left the order.Especially meeting the sisters was something so important to her now, which she never would have been able to inside the orders boundaries and rules |
| Scene 5 - Danger of the chips | They stay silent for a moment before Ahsoka says what she thinks. She tells them, that her gut and the force are telling her, that those chips are dangerous and that she vows to help the clones if that is the case, that Fives didn't die in vain, that she is willing to make his sacrifice count. Internally she hesitates just a moment before vowing this, as she wonders what this might unleash and what it might cost her. But she pushes it aside almost immediately, this is more important. The other look at one another for a moment, silently talking, acknowledging her, before they look at her with aw as she ends her speech. She notices and asks what they are looking at. To which Rex says, that the clones usually do not get treated this nicely by Jedi or other Reg's who they work with. Kix nods and adds since General Skywalker left and after you went away, it is somewhat refreshing to have someone care about us again for a change. Ahsoka smiles sadly at that and says that she is sorry, to which both Rex and Kix begin to shake their heads and hands before them, telling her, that that is not what they meant, that she did nothing wrong. Ahsoka just smiles at them and says, that she won't leave them again and that she vows to do anything for them, which is in her might. And that Anakin will do so as well. Kix looks at Rex and he just brushes him off as to tell him "later". Ahsoka does not catch this interaction. I will get us a place and tools and will inform you once I am ready. She says and the others nod. Rex says that he will look into a save way to get their hands on such a chip with Kix, so that no other Fives has to happen. Ahsoka smiles and then stands up and asks them, if they will show her to the rest of the 501st, so she can say her hellos. Rex and Kix nod and walk with her out of the door, not before Ahsoka has removed her chip from Rex's station and deleted the search history and database access. For this moment she will just allow herself to be happy and around some of her friends she made in the GAR. |

#### Chapter 5: Sleepy Planing
Ahsoka tells Anakin about the plan she, Rex and Kix have conducted and asks him to come with her to the lower levels.

| Scenes | Description |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Ahsoka thinks | Ahsoka spend some time with Rex and all the others of the 501st. They talk about all they went through together and the ones they lost along the way. Hardcase, Tup, Dogma, Fives, Echo and so much more who have been lost to the ever strifeling war. Ahsoka can not place the feeling, but this war felt endless to her and so useless in the end. She had talked to the people, seen how they live now that she is no longer part of the Jedi order. What the Jedi should stand for, what they should protect is long since gone. What they remain are warriors and the people see them as such. As also responsible for the war and the plight they experience. She had talked to and met separatists and seen how they live, what they want. And she cannot say that that is wrong. She has seen systems and people who try to stay neutral. Mandalore and their people, their queen and their students. All of this seems so wrong, so out of place, so fake. She cannot place where these thoughts come from, but she knows that something is up and she can feel, that the biochips have something to do with all of this. They are the key to this mystery somehow and she will see it through until they know what is going on. Until Fives death was not as useless as the deaths of all the other clones buried in nameless graves on planets they should have never been on. While she makes her way back to Anakin she thinks about all of this. She had talked to the clones to the 501st and they still seemed like she remembered them, how she remembered her life, but anything else seems and feels different. Walking outside the other clones look different, behave different. More uniform, more strict more life- and joyless. There was a huge amount of gray even when she was part of the GAR, but now all color seems to be sucked from things giving the GAR and the clones this faceless feel to them, it almost has something oppressive to it, but she probably overthinks this. She remembers the light feeling of being with the clones coming up with designs for their armour as each one had ideas to show their individuality, now she can only see standard stripes on other clones. By now it is late into the night, the day laying hard on her shoulders. She had met with Obi-Wan, found Anakin, talked to Padmé, found out about Fives death and met with the 501st. She could use some sleep right about now, but she had promised him to return and she intends to keep that promise. She hasn't sorted through all the strange feelings she had experienced this day yet, but for now this was to much to be asked to do. She compartmentalizes them and pushes them away for the day, she will get nowhere with this now anyway. For a moment she concentrates on the bond she shares with Anakin and to her joy she can feel him. Distant and faint, but she can feel their connection again, where before she was only slightly sure he wasn't dead. |
| Scene 2 - Walk in | Groggily she parks her bike, pays the warden no mind and walks back to Anakin's apartment. There she lets herself in again and without a thought walks into the living room. There she stops dead in her tracks as she sees Anakin stand before her only glad in a towel, looking at her perplexed as he drying off his hair with another smaller towel. She feels her face burn up and spins around fast mumbling an apology for walking in on him, ready to run away. She is halted in her movement as she hears him chuckle behind her. Slowly she turns around again looking at him to see a small smile on his face. There where few genuine ones during the day, so she is happy to see it, but she also has to pout because of it. She asks what is so funny and he tells her, that her antics are quite funny. He continues with saying that they have shared rooms much smaller than this throughout the war in conditions worse and unforgiving, seen the other at their best and worst and through everyday task. So he finds it funny, that she is so flustered by seeing him out of the shower, which she had seen before many many times. He just shakes his head and continues on drying his hair. Ahsoka is a bit perplexed about herself now as she has to agree, this scene is nothing out of the ordinary for them, it is quite normal to be honest. During their time together and on the battlefield they always tried to keep a decorum of decency and privacy, but seeing the other clad in only towels or even less was normal. But this feels somehow different. Seeing Anakin this way is different. She can feel how her face is still hot while she looks him over. She never has noticed how well build he is, how well his muscles move below his skin. Even now, after he has left the order and began treating himself less than nicely he seemed to still be quite fit. "Why does he look different now?" She couldn't place these feelings again, they were new to the other new ones from earlier that day. She could just about stop herself from walking over to him and touching his body, feel his heat and the movement of his biceps as they flex while they move. She feels a strange need. She shakes her head out of these feelings and asks if it is okay if she uses the shower also. Anakin looks at her, his emotionless and tired face from before returned, as he only nods and says that there are enough towels and that he disinfected the whole bathroom before he used it. She looked at him a bit questioningly as he looked away from her. He explained that he never used the bathroom her before and that this room is not expensive enough or placed well enough, so that he would trust in the cleaning. That he does not know what the people before him did in there. Ahsoka gets his meaning as she just nods and turns around to hide her again reddening face. They never had talked about things like that before. Jedi usually did not have to of course. She goes to the shower and closes the door, locking it behind her. She somehow does feel the need to do that. She takes off her clothes, now a bit more modest to before, where she showed off a bit too much for her taste now after a few years. She stepped into the shower and let the hot water run over her tired body as she massaged it a bit, pressing out the stress of the day, as she let her mind become empty in a impromptu meditation, to calm down after the day. Stepping out she notices, that she didn't bring any spare clothes. She is used to wearing the same for a long period of time, but she could use something comfy and new right about now. Inspired by Anakin's choice of clothing after the shower she takes a few of the towels to wrap herself up in. For some reason she feels the need to use one, which only covers herself from her breasts to about the mid of her thighs, which reveals a lot of her shape and skin. She is surprised at herself for wanting his attention in this way, but she pushes it away, not wanting to overthink this. It feels right, she wants him to see. While stopping to think about it, she grabs another one and walks out. |
| Scene 3 - Discussion | As she steps back into the living room, she can see, that Anakin has thrown over a shirt and is wearing some long pants, both issued by the GAR. He does not seem like the type who would buy himself a set of new and fancy clothing after he left the order and the GAR, just grabbing a few packs of clothes and let that be it. She is a bit disappointed but also has to smile a bit at that. He sits on the small couch which also is situated in the room looking up as the door opens. She walks to one of the chairs they sat on before, letting her side face him, as she began drying her legs. She could feel his gaze on her body. Not just looking at her, but letting his gaze roam. She felt a bit giddy about that. She liked it even. While drying she let the towel she wore slip up dangerously high, making more visible than she ever would have and she can feel his eyes on her exposed skin close to her core. She likes the attention, not letting him notice that she knows that he looks. Soon she questions what she is doing though, as she remembers what she wanted to talk about with him. Concerning the plan with Fives and the biochips. Turning her gaze to him, she could see him look away quickly, making her smile. She finished up drying and walked over to him letting herself flop on the couch next to him. They looked at each other, the air somewhat tense again, but she was the first to break the silence. She tells him that Rex and the 501st says hi. To which Anakin's face falls and he looks away. She tells him, that Rex misses him and not only he. He still does not look at her and gives no sign of acknowledging it, as she can only guess how he reprimands himself and tells himself that he is not worthy of seeing them again. She lets it rest for now, but she intends to make this right also. Before she opens with, that he didn't tell her that Fives had died. To which Anakin looks at her again apologetic. She doesn't really blame him, but wanted his attention back. She tells him, that it is okay, but that she will not just let his death be in vain. Anakin looks thoughtful at that, before he nods in agreement, saying that Fives and all the clones deserve better who died, but how she intends to do it. She tells him about what she, Rex and Kix had found and talked about, telling him also that she used his codes, to which he chuckles a bit. Saying that he taught her well. He is deep in thought about it as he tells her, that he remembers what Fives had said before he died, but that he never had the time to give it some mind before. Ahsoka tells him, that she can feel something sinister behind it, that it feels like something important, that her gut and the force tell her to investigate it. Anakin looks at her and nods, he admits that he not always trusted in the force, but that if she can feel its will this strongly, she probably should listen to it. She smiles, seeing some of the old Anakin shine through as she continues and tells him of the plan they have come up with and that she had contacts. He raises an eyebrow at that, but does not ask. She tells him that she plans on meeting with someone in the lower levels the next day. He looks away a sombre smile on his face. She continues in saying that she wants him to go with her. At that he looks at her with wide eyes. She says that he cannot just sit here in this room all day long and drink himself to death. And besides he also agreed to honoring Fives death and finding out more about this, so why not join. He seems hesitant. Ahsoka tells him, that he does not have to do much, but that she would feel saver with him around and that she does not intend to leave him alone and behind. He smiles a bit and tells her that he will think about it. His mind still filled with self-doubt as he frowns thinking that she deserves someone better to help her. Ahsoka wants to protest, but after this long day she feels too tired to do so and just agrees. Not intending to let him not come with her. Anakin looks at her and says that she can have the bed if she wants, that he also cleaned it and gave it some new sheets. She thanks him, not wanting to leave now anyway, but asks where he intends to sleep. He just points to the couch, to which Ahsoka looks at him like he is an idiot. Telling him she will not let him sleep on the couch. That the bed would be big enough for the both of them. She didn't think too much about saying that, they have slept in minimal space close to one another before. They both smile at the idea a bit. He does not seem to think anything by it as he just silently agrees, seeming as tired as she feels somehow. So she also ignores the strange feelings which come up in her belly once again. |
| Scene 4 - Good night | They walk to the bedroom so they can have a look and the bed is generously big they notice, so there really is no problem in sharing. But as Ahsoka looks down at herself she notices a big lack in clothing. A bit red again she turns to Anakin who looks at her and seems to understand what she is thinking. He walks to something looking like a travel backpack and pulls out a shirt and some boxer shorts as well as another of the long pants he is also wearing giving it to her saying that she can have those, that he "borrowed" enough from the GAR to keep him clothed for a few years she just smiles as she walks into the bathroom, quickly changing into it. The boxer shorts fit well enough but both the shirt and pants are too long for her petite small form. The shirt covers her bum and the shorts almost completely and the pants are too long to walk in, so she just leaves them off. Like this she walks into the bedroom again, feeling Anakin's gaze on her once more for a mere moment, as she notices how her getup looks. But she does not feel embarrassed anymore. Maybe she is too tired but she also likes his attention on her. He already sits on one side of the bed, so she makes her way to the other side. without another word spoke they both lay on their respective side and turn of the lights. Only their breathing can be heard in the small room. Anakin says with a tired voice "Night Snips" and she answers "Night Skyguy". As she feels sleep already tugging at her eyelids and drifts off. In the night she awakes to weird noises. She notices that Anakin is churning a bit in his sleep, mumbling things. She can feel his tenseness over their bond. He seems to have a nightmare. She briefly debates if she should wake him, but decides against it, in favor of him getting a much needed full nights sleep Under the blanket they share she reaches out her hand and finds his, clasping it. It presses back and she sends some calming energy over their bond, stopping his churning and mumbling, soliciting a relieved sigh from him. She smiles and slowly drifts off to sleep again too. Their hands still intertwined, his big hand warm and comforting. She thinks of all the fears of failure and not being enough of a Jedi which Anakin had helped her with in the past and dissipated with her. She could feel how both of them have changed as she fell asleep again with a sad smile. |

#### Chapter 6: Bonds and Boundaries
Ahsoka and Anakin’s bond deepens, with moments of vulnerability and friction around Ahsoka’s autonomy.

| Scenes | Description |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Morning troubles | As Ahsoka awakes again, she feels refreshed, warm and cozy. She does not want to stand up yet but as she looks around, she is meet with a room she does not recognize. She tenses but as she squeezes her hand, she feels Anakin's big hand still around it as she looks to the side where his face lays really close to her, still sleeping. The events of the last day come flooding back into her mind as she thinks about them and the strange feeling in her stomach which had pestered her since the last whenever she got close to Anakin returned. Looking over she could see his face more closely than she ever had before. His smooth features and strong chin and the bags bellow his eyes and the wear on his face after long years of war. He is not that much older than her, but the last few years have edged their way into himself and everything that happened to him has made him into the man before her. A fundamentally broken man, who believes he deserves to be miserable. That she cannot let stand. Without thinking her other hand wanders to his face and her finger slowly traces the scar next to his eye. She always had seen it, but she never asked where he had gotten it. He had fought so hard in his life yet he was so resilient and kept going forward, he will get through this as well, she is sure of it. As she absentmindedly traces it with her finger, Anakin began to stir and she could feel him wake up. Quickly she withdraws her hand but keeps looking at his face. His eyes slowly open and she can see the same thing that happened to her see happen in his eyes as he tries to make out where he is. He tilts his head to the side and they look eyes, their faces only millimeters apart, but none of them pull back. A moment goes bye before one of them speaks but then his groggy voice reaches her Lekku saying good morning Snips. She says good morning back and they stay like that for a little while, staring at one another and still holding hands. Ahsoka's communicator breaks this spell as it beeps in the background, making them realize what they are doing. Ahsoka unsure of the feelings inside her again, which are so unfamiliar to her. They immediately move away from another and unclasp their hands, as Anakin sits up and stretches his arms. His robotic arm still malfunctioning a bit. Ahsoka smiles at that and tells him, that they need to fix his arm, before it explodes on him. He just chuckles and says that he at least can throw it as a bomb if need be then. They chuckles as Ahsoka also stands up and walks to her communicator. She has two messages one from Rex telling her that he and Kix are ready to move on the plan once she has settled her end and one from Padmé. She looks at it surprised as she cannot fathom how Padmé got the contact of her private com, before she remembers that she gave it to her when she was stationed as her body guard and stopped Aurra Sing. Looking at the message she feels conflicted. It just tells her, that it was nice to see her again the day before and that this com hopefully still belongs to her. That Padmé would like to meet with her this evening if that would be alright with her. There is no mention of Anakin, so she hesitantly sends a quick message agreeing. Anakin seems to sense her unrest as he asks her if everything is fine. She turns around and smiles not sure if she should tell him, but decides on being truthful. Padmé reached out to me. She wants to meet me this evening. Anakin looks away at that his face unreadable and now that he is sober his mind shields are also up again more securely. He just says I see. Ahsoka is unsure of what to make of this so she asks, if it would be okay for her to do so. He looks at her with an O-face, obviously not expecting her to ask this, before he tells her, that she can do what she wants to do and that his situation with Padmé does not have to deter her from doing so. She can see some hurt in his eyes, but they are probably from thinking about her, so she let's it rest. She walks over to him and sits next to him on the bed looking at him expectantly. Anakin asks her what she wants and she says if he has decided to go with her or not. He seems to remember but still seems hesitant. She rolls her eyes and says, that he comes with her, end of discussion. He opens his mouth to protest but closes it and gives her a small nod. |
| Scene 2 - Shared Mission | Ahsoka managed to drag Anakin out of his room. He wears a casual outfit he took with him from his temple days. They removed anything which looked Jedi specific and just made him look presentable. Ahsoka also wanted to brush his hair but he stopped her there, his hair stay like they are. She wears the same gear as the day before again, just leaving on the shorts bellow as she has no new underwear. They sit together on her speeder and with her in front he leans on her and clasps his arms around her waist, making her heart skip a beat somehow although this also is nothing new to them. They make their way a bit lower into the planet before Ahsoka stops the speeder and walks in front of him. They share some silence. It is not a charged silence but a comfortable one. Anakin hasn't asked her yet where they are going so she looks at him walking one step behind her asking if he doesn't want to know where they are going. He looks at her and shrugs, saying that in this kind of situations it is normally better not to ask, as there may be information he shouldn't know for their safety, if it is something illegal. She pouts at him and says that her plan is not illegal... not quite at least, to which she earns a little chuckle. They make their way to the hanger where she works and lives now together with the sisters. As they make their way there and walk into the hanger she can feel Anakin's interest pike as he sees the machinery and ships standing around in obvious state of repair. As he begins to look around Ahsoka is taken in by his childlike amazement and feels too late as someone runs past her, which is followed by Trace screaming at the top of her lungs to stop the Quarren from fleeing. The moment happens so fast that she is unable to react in time, but as she looks back she can see Anakin go into action without a single moment delay. He grabs the Quarren as he tries to run away, quickly forcing him to the ground on his knees easily subduing him and holding him there without him being able to move. The Quarren curses but Anakin keeps him there with controlled force and Ahsoka can swear to see some semblance of happiness on his face. Before she can see anything Trace comes running with star struck eyes immediately stepping next to Anakin, bombarding him with questions "Wow! You were so fast! How did you do that? Are you a Jedi too? Do you guys always catch people like that?". Anakin seems to be a bit overwhelmed by this and looks to Ahsoka for help, who just shrugs chuckles, leaving the situation for him to resolve, much to his displeasure and her amusement. "Who are you?" Trace asks, not breathing between questions. "Yes... That is what I want to know too." another voice suddenly interjects as Rafa walks up beside Ahsoka crossing her arms and looking at Anakin with contempt and distrust but also some intrigue. Ahsoka's smile fades as she is meet with the situation she already knew was going to happen, but she knows that the sisters trust her and so she has no reason to lie to them and begins with the truth. She introduces Anakin as her former Jedi Master and another Jedi who has left the order just as her. And she introduces the sisters to Anakin as friends she made along the way, with particular sets of skills. Anakin seems fascinated as he still holds the Quarren and looks between the sisters. Rafa seems interested but still guarded asking. "Leaving the Jedi, huh? That’s not an easy decision. So what happened? You got tired of living up in those pristine towers while the rest of us fought to survive down here?" Anakin is seemingly affected by that question as he opens his mouth slightly but then closes it again looking down clenching his fist, thinking to himself. Ahsoka steps in as she does not want this situation to escalate. Telling Rafa that his reasons for leaving may be different than hers, that she understands their distrust of the Jedi and now understands their perspective better after she lived and fought with them, but that Anakin is as trustworthy as her. That he trained her and was her mentor, which has to mean something looking at who she is now. Who is someone Rafa trusts. Rafa looks not completely convinced, but as she looks at Anakin again, who is still staring at the floor in thought she sighs and says "I guess..." and gives Ahsoka a faint smile. Before walking up to Anakin in the Quarren pulling him out of his thoughts as he looks up at her with interest. She kneels down in front of the Quarren looking up at Anakin saying "Anakin right? Thanks for catching this one, but I got it from here." He smiles slightly while nodding at his name before letting go of the Quarren and standing up. Rafa immediately slaps the Quarren across the face and tells him that he should know better than to flee without paying. She easily presses the money he ows her out of him, much to Anakin's amusement. As the situation resolves and the Quarren walks away defeated Rafa turns to Ahsoka again asking what it is they came her for. All the while Trace has taken a liking to Anakin as she talks to him looking at his robotic arm studying it as they talk about tech stuff. He even seems to be stoked to be talking to another nerd like himself. Ahsoka smiles and turns to Rafa explaining that she is in need of some specific medical equipment and that if Rafa could pull some strings to get them, she would even pay. Rafa's face is unmoving as she asks for why she needs them. Ahsoka looks at her and says that she has a plan, a dangerous plan which could rile up the Jedi and the Republic forces if it gets found out, if Rafa really does wanna know. At this Rafa smiles and says that she doesn't need to know, but that that is reason enough to help if it can piss of the higher ups. She promises her help and even allows Ahsoka to build the equipment in her personal space of the hanger to do it there, as it would be more discrete to have the stuff brought here and then let it disappear after use, so that anyone looking would think they just transported some goods. Ahsoka is thankful and promises to pay her back, but Rafa just shakes her head looking at Trace laughing with Anakin, saying that it is fine in a for her uncommon tone of sincerity. She asks Ahsoka if she is gonna help her old master, to which Ahsoka looks at her and Rafa smiles saying she knows someone broken when she sees them. Ahsoka just nods to which Rafa smiles and gets going already calling someone on her comlink the list of stuff Ahsoka needs given to her already by Ahsoka who talked it through with Kix before. |
| Scene 3 - Emotional Breakthrough | As Rafa goes about trying to get her hands on the medical equipment Trace has wandered off to work on something again leaving Anakin and Ahsoka alone. He has a look on his face she can not place as he stares into the lower city from the hanger doors. Ahsoka goes up to him and notices his slightly broken and jittering robotic arm again. She tells him to come with her and he does so without protest. They walk to her personal space where she has her workshop and tools. There she tells him to sit. He looks confused and she tells him, that she will repair his arm, that this thing is bothering her. Normally she would have expected him to refuse or brush her off, maybe even wanting to do it himself, but to her surprise he just nods and accepts her help, as he lays his arm on the table next to him. She gets to work directly as they once again share a moment of silence. This time it is Anakin who breaks it. He suddenly begins talking, his voice sombre. Telling her that Rafa's question made him think. Why he left the Jedi order and subsequently what he wants to do now. He tells her, that his reasons where not as noble as hers, that he had thought about leaving the order before, to escape their bureaucracy and their complacency. That he even thought about leaving because of Padmé and himself. But that he never did so, that he never would have left the security and stability that the order provided, the place in this world the war and the GAR gave him. That he never would have left, because the people suffer under them. He tells her about his time as a slave and says that he has seen slavery and suffering everywhere. That he thought about why that had to be and why the order had forsaken these people, but that he never even went about changing something. Having Rafa ask him that brought back the memories of his own upbringing and how the injustice in the galaxy has not subsided since he became a Jedi, who he thought were the people to make these things right. He didn't leave because of all of that, he left, because he couldn't stand not meeting the expectations of the people around him, of not being able to keep them save, of not having his wife stay with him. He told her with sad eyes and a little hesitancy that Padmé told him, that she needed a pause. That she did not want to continue like this, where he would go of into a war she wants to end and he actively prolongs. That his blind loyalty to the Republic and the order was misplaced, as they are corrupt and misguided, that there needs to be change and he is anything but. He tells her that he couldn't see it then, that he didn't want change, as it would mean he maybe would lose his own purpose. That he didn't want to lose his man. Rex. Or anyone in the 501st. But that need to keep things as they are for himself ended in him losing Ahsoka, losing Padmé and with that losing parts of himself. And that that culminated in him loosing everything. He became sloppy and his men had to die pointlessly. He thought leaving would make it more save for them, but that in doing so he forsake them and removed his protection from them and the help he could have provided. He tells her that he whished he could undo the deaths he had so unthinkingly allowed, he whished he could make life better for the people like Rafa and all the others, that he whished for change too as did Padmé, that he just was to focused on himself and still is, that he didn't see it then. That he forsake all of that and in the end lost everything, the people he loved, his purpose his life, which he worked so hard not to lose. And all of that for the wrong reasons. Ahsoka listens to him and feels her heart ache at his story and how he sees himself. She feels a mixture of relief and sadness as Anakin opens up, sensing both his pain and the weight he carries. They stay silent for a moment before she begins to speak. She tells him, that it does not matter why he left the order. That she may have left because she didn't trust the order anymore and was disillusioned with it. But that she also mostly left because of her own reasons and because she needed to see and do things for her own. The only thing that matters is what he does with his life now, that he left. If he drinks himself to death in some hole never to be seen again, or if he uses his abilities and his compassion to help where he can. She is silent for a moment. Telling him then, how worried Rex is for him and how bad Rex feels for not being able to help him more. That he is allowed to heal and be at peace with himself but that ultimately it is his decision to allow himself to heal. And that he is not the only one who decides if he is forgiven or not, that this always needs two. Smiling at him she tells him, that she wanted to bring him along to see how he would deal with the sisters and this new situation and that she was happy to see him smile with Trace, be thoughtful with Rafa and still able to do good and stop people with bad intention like the Quarren from before. That it is his choice. He tells him, that he is already here and part of the plan, that he should stay and meet with Rex and Kix and see for himself how they feel about him and if they can forgive him, that they want to do so. At this she finishes up what she was working on, smiling at his now seemingly repaired arm, which he directly looked at and moved a bit. He smiled at her slightly saying that it was very good. He jests that he will have to do some of his own adjustments and improvements, but that for her handy work it was good, to which Ahsoka laughs and punches him in the arm. After a short moment of silence he thanks her, as he for a moment allows himself to believe her, before standing up and walking around the space looking at the repairs which have been started there. Ahsoka is relieved to see him a bit better, but she knows, that this will be a long road to go. He asks him if he wants to help out a bit, which he gives her a small smile and nods. Together they begin working on repairing an old speeder, just enjoying the time together. They do this for quite some while until Ahsoka's com beeps reminding her of her meeting with Padmé her heart sinks a bit at that, still unsure about all of this and how she should behave with her. Anakin notices and asks what's wrong. She tells him, that she needs to go in a bit to meet with Padmé. Anakin's face falls a bit at that, but he nods. She wants to say something, but he is faster. He tells her to not worry about him, that it is okay and smiles. He tells her, that she should just go and he will stay here repairing the speeder and wait for Rafa's return. She smiles back at him and nods. She wipes her hands clean of the oil with a piece of cloth and makes her way to her speeder. |
| Scene 4 - Tension with Padmé | Ahsoka makes her way to Padmé's apartment. It is somewhat weird to think, that it also was Anakin's apartment not too long ago. She is a bit indecisive still on how to handle all of this but a part of her also is happy to meet with an old friend. She parks her bike and makes it into the apartment complex, she still knows where Padmé's apartment is, so she bypasses the front desk and makes her way directly into the elevator and up to Padmé's floor. She calms her nerves and walks up to her door and rings. It takes a moment, but then the door opens and before her stands Padmé wearing something comfy her real hair flowing down her head. Seeing her like this, she can understand why Anakin would like a woman like her. What is she thinking? Padmé beams at her before hugging her, which Ahsoka returns with a slight chuckle. She had missed her too when she is honest with herself. Padmé bits her inside and they begin talking. She asks what has happened to her since she left the order and how she fares now. Ahsoka tells her a bit about herself and that she meet the sisters and works and lives in Trace's workshop. She deliberately leaves out the illegal and dangerous parts she had been part of. She also asks Padmé how she has been, to which she tells her a bit about the way she tries to finally end the war and works together with some senator friends to achieve this, in particular she mentions Bail Organa, who is one of her strongest supporters. They sit on the couch together and while Ahsoka still feels a little tense they have a pleasant conversation, but it does not take too long until Padmé looks a bit more serious and asks her about Anakin. Ahsoka can feel her face fall a bit at that and looks down. She is silent for a moment and then looks back up at Padmé who looks a bit worried at her. Ahsoka tells her that he wasn't too well when she found him yesterday, she tells her that he was drinking and looking disheveled. All the while Padmé's face becomes more and more sombre. Ahsoka tells her that he had come out with her today and they worked a bit in her workshop, that he seems a bit better, but that it will be a long way until he feels better and allows himself to heal. At this Padmé looks a bit questioningly, so Ahsoka explains that Anakin feels responsible for the death of a few of his men and that he feels as if he failed at everything, that he feels like he deserves the way he feels now. Padmé completely deflates now and sighs. Looking at her legs she says more to herself than to Ahsoka, what she has done. Ahsoka shakes her head and tells her, that it is not her fault, at least not alone. That Ahsoka had also left him behind, but that she will not make the same mistake again. Padmé smiles a bit at that. She says that for her it is a bit too late to fix it. That she has pushed him away and said some nasty things because she had been tired of him fighting in this war and being so trusting of the Republic and the order. She tells her that she never meant to hurt him, that she just wanted a pause to think about things, that she still loves him, but that he probably will never forgive her. Ahsoka cringes a bit at her saying she still loves her, which Padmé notices. With a slight smile she asks Ahsoka if she likes Anakin. Ahsoka looks perplexed and tells her yes, that he is her old master and her friend. Padmé just smiles and says, that Ahsoka probably feels more than that for him. She understands what she is hinting on and wants to refute. Her mouth only opens, but she cannot say the words. She is not sure herself anymore as she feels a pang of guilt, reluctance and confusion. Padmé sighs and smiles and tells her that it was good to see her again, that she has to get ready for a dinner party with some senators she tries to get to her side and help her to get the senate to accept some of her whishes for change. Ahsoka nods, her mind racing as the emotions within her almost boil over as she tries do understand herself what is happening to her. She stands up and Padmé brings her to the door and gives her farewells, before she closes the door though she tells her, that she should keep an eye on Anakin, that she is the best help for him right now. At the end she quickly adds that she probably will never get Anakin to forgive her and take her back, but that she will not give up this fast and leave him to her. With a smile she closes the door and Ahsoka feels a tinge at her heart as she is debating kicking in the door again. |
| Scene 5 - Ahsoka alone | On her way back to the workshop, the cool night air whipping past, Ahsoka let her thoughts drift to Anakin. Her mind raced over everything Padmé had hinted, everything she had been feeling, and the steady, quiet connection that now felt stronger than ever. Did she feel more for Anakin than just friendship? If she was honest, her attachment to him was undeniable. She’d risked so much for him already, crossed boundaries she never thought she would. And thinking of him with Padmé left her with a pang of something she didn’t entirely understand—but maybe she didn’t want to. Yet, a different thought crept in, unbidden and unsettling. She’d left the Jedi Order to find herself, to walk her own path without the ties that had once defined her life. Here she was, pulled by emotions so fierce they seemed to threaten the independence she’d fought so hard to claim. She wasn’t even sure if that was what she wanted, but it troubled her all the same. She shook her head, trying to push the doubt away. It was just one moment, one passing feeling. She could still be there for him, care for him, and stay true to herself… couldn’t she? |

#### Chapter 7: Hidden Resolve
Rafa managed to get her hands on the equipment needed, which they prepare before Rex and Kix meet them.

| Scenes | Description |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Two days later | It’s midday in the workshop, sunlight filtering through the dusty windows and casting a warm, muted glow over the busy, cluttered space. Ahsoka watches as Anakin, wearing an old work shirt with the sleeves rolled up, crouches by a broken speeder with Trace, guiding her through a tricky repair. Ahsoka finds herself observing Anakin with a strange mix of relief and curiosity. Over the past two days, he has worked alongside Trace and her, helping with repairs, even sharing laughs with Trace. It feels like a small glimpse of who he might become if he can move past his burdens. She feels grateful to Rafa and Trace for how naturally they’ve accepted him, though she wonders if they sense the weight he’s carrying. It is a start, but she can still see how the worry eats away at him and how in moments he feels unobserved, he will look just as broken and lost as he has the first day she had seen him again, drunk in the little dirty room of that rundown motel. They had checked him out since and she had paid for the damage he had done to the room, the warden seemed to be really unhappy about it, but Ahsoka's cold stare has kept him quite about it. Since then Anakin had lived with her, sleeping on her small couch in her own apartment. It feels good having him around and even the whirlwind of emotions she had faced after visiting Padmé had subsided a bit. She is still unsure of what she really feels and if that will make things harder or not, but she can accept that for now. Looking at him and living with him, having him around her again feels good. It is different than before, but that does not make it worse. Just as she’s reflecting on this, Rafa strides over, a self-satisfied grin on her face arms crossed. "You didn’t mention just how much legwork this ‘favor’ would involve, Tano," Rafa quips, setting a bag down with some medical tools she had also requested and dusting off her hands. Ahsoka chuckles, meeting her friend’s gaze. "I appreciate it, Rafa. You have no idea how important this is." Rafa’s grin fades slightly, and her eyes hold a glimmer of understanding. "Oh, I have a pretty good idea. Just... make sure they don't track you here to the shop when you do whatever you need to do with this equipment. I don't even wanna know, but it's clear that this will be something big." They exchange a small smile, Ahsoka feeling the unspoken tension behind Rafa’s words. Ahsoka can sense the undercurrent of risk in Rafa’s tone, feeling the weight of what’s to come settling in. She’s thankful that Anakin has had these days to connect with others and that she has, in Rafa and Trace, people she can rely on. She never intended to put them in danger with this, but Rafa is right, this could very well become really dangerous. They don't know who might have an interest in stopping them from finding out more about those chips. After Fives death everything was really quickly made confidential and every investigation into the matter was stopped. No one cared to look further. Not even the Jedi who knew that something was wrong with this. What they intend to do, can be fabricated as something treasons. She may not like it, but in the eye of the Republic, the clones are just things, pieces of equipment. What they intend to do is to make invasive changes to those tools, which when found out, will surely end not well. She and Anakin are no longer military personal, which makes this even riskier. But she had promised Rex to help with finding out what happened to Fives and these chips were the first step to do that. And the bad feeling connected to them is still bothering her. She knows that they mean nothing good, which is all the more reason to get to the bottom of this. |
| Scene 2 - Messaging Rex | Ahsoka steps into a quieter corner of the workshop, away from the noise of the repairs. The communicator in her hand feels heavier than usual, but she will not let that fear stop her from doing what she knows needs to be done. She takes a deep breath, calming herself as she sends a brief message: "Rex, we’re set. We have what we need. If you’re ready, meet me at these coordinates tonight." As she presses send, she feels a flood of emotions — excitement, anticipation, and a nagging sense of fear about the unknown consequences of what they’re planning. She tucks her communicator away, leaning against the wall and taking a moment to center herself. Her instincts are clear: this is the right path, no matter the risks. Ahsoka thinks back to her decision to leave the Jedi Order, the choice that started her on this journey. She’s learned to trust herself since then, to act on her instincts without hesitation. Now, guiding Rex and Anakin in this endeavor, she feels a fierce resolve to protect them, and a certainty in her own ability to lead whatever this is. Whatever comes next, she’ll face it without regret. Standing alone, Ahsoka senses the gravity of her choices. She’s on the cusp of something that will test her loyalty and courage, but she feels ready, stronger and more grounded than she has in a long time. |
| Scene 3 - Setting Up | The message send she steps back to the others. Rafa is watching Trace and Anakin work together a small smile on her face. She would never admit to such, but she liked Anakin and liked having him around the last few days, Ahsoka could tell. Stepping next to her she gave her a knowing smile, to which she just earned a "What are you looking at?" with a small pout. With a chuckle she stepped to Anakin and Trace, who almost finished in repairing the speeder they had been working on all morning. Anakin gives her a small smile as Trace was still arms deep in the speeder, greeting her with an enthusiastic "Hey". Ahsoka kneels down next to Anakin and tells him, that Rafa has managed to get everything they need and that she already informed Rex and Kix and that they will come here this evening if they can make it. His smile fades a bit at that, as she can see the subtle self-loathing in his eyes at the mention of Rex, but she lays a hand on his shoulder making him look at her. She tells him, that everything will be fine, that seeing Rex will be something good. He nods and smiles a bit. She tells him, that they need to make everything ready. She also tells him about her thoughts, of how dangerous this is and that they need to be careful not to raise too much unwanted attention as to not also endangering Trace and Rafa, at which Trace transitions her focus on her too. Anakin nods and tells her, that he thought about that too, but that he also ows it to Fives and Rex to go through with it, that if her feeling is correct, this is the only right thing to do. He also says that he usually went against the order and ended up doing a lot of things he shouldn't have, which he taught her well too, so they probably get away with it again too. Ahsoka laughs at that, while Trace only looks on with big eyes. Trace suddenly says to the both of them, that she does not know what exactly they are up to, but that is sounds important and that they should not think to much about her and Rafa, that it will be fine. Both Ahsoka and Anakin beam at her and thank her for her trust. Ahsoka tells Anakin, that they need to build up the equipment first, before they can actually use it. Anakin nods and even Trace stands up with them wanting to help. They try to keep her out of it, but she insists. Even Rafa begins helping too. A back corner of the workshop has been cleared out, all of them work quickly to transform it into a makeshift medical space. Curtains are hung from improvised poles, tools are laid out on a workbench, and Rafa has dragged an old medical cot into position. Ahsoka carefully organizes the tools she’ll need while Trace is busy stringing up a small lamp above the cot to provide focused light. Rafa gestures to the equipment, adding a few quiet instructions on keeping things discreet. "If anyone starts asking questions, you’ll want to make this stuff vanish fast," she says, her voice low but firm. Ahsoka nods, grateful for Rafa’s pragmatism and street smarts that contrast with her own experience. Rafa hands Ahsoka a few more tools and meets her gaze. "I don’t need to know what this is about," she says with a knowing smirk. "But if it’s ruffling feathers in high places, that’s reason enough to lend a hand." Ahsoka smiles, feeling both gratitude and the tension of impending risk. "Thank you, Rafa. I’ll make sure it’s worth it." Withe the four of them they quickly manage to build up anything they would need. Rafa and Trace wish both of them luck as they leave them behind once evening strikes. They don't want to be in the way and this is something Ahsoka and Anakin have to do on their own. |
| Scene 4 - Rex’s Arrival | The workshop is dim and quiet as dusk settles. Ahsoka waits by the door, her gaze fixed on the entrance. Anakin is nearby, his demeanor serious and focused as he prepares himself mentally for what’s about to unfold. Rex and Kix arrive quietly, dressed down in civilian clothes, with hoods pulled up to avoid recognition. As they make there way inside they pull down their hoods and look around the space with interest. Rex's eyes land on Anakin who is standing quietly in a corner of the room looking back at him. It's silent for a moment, before Rex makes his way down to where Anakin is standing. Ahsoka has never seen Anakin this nervous before. They had fought together, almost died together countless times, facing odds nobody else would take and he always was determined and ready to face it. But now he seemed like a youngling, unsure of himself and unsure of what would happen to him now. Rex's face was unreadable as he walked over and even Ahsoka began to question his intentions a bit. Anakin began talking stuttering unlike himself trying to find the words, to apologize for everything, but before he could finish Rex opened his arms and took him in a brief but powerful embrace. Similar to how he had greeted Ahsoka when she stepped into his office, but still different. With her it was like relief of meeting his best friend again, with Anakin it was like he finally found his long lost brother. She knew they were close, they never really expressed that, but they trusted on another fully and Ahsoka knew that Rex always valued Anakin and his views on the clones highly. The moment passed as Rex stepped back and they shared a mute smile. At this Kix stepped up beside Rex and looked at Anakin. "Well well General, you look like shit. So nothing has changed I guess." It took a moment but then all four of them burst into laughing. The tense atmosphere from before all but forgotten. Anakin and Rex nodded at one another, no words were needed right now of everything that had happened. Kix noticed this too and turned to Ahsoka, asking her where she had all the equipment. She smiled and told them to follow her as she brought them to the makeshift medical area they had devised. Kix whistles as he sees it and immediately looks at all the equipment and takes it in hand scrutinizing it for anything odd he could catch, but to Ahsoka's relieve he does not find anything. "I hope I pass muster Kix." she jokes and he chuckles telling her that everything looks fine. Anakin joins in and asks what the plan is now. Kix nods and tells them, that they may have read the reports and that the general and Rex where with Fives as it ended, but that they need to be sure that those chips exist before they can do anything. And that if they exist they need to remove one of them to examine it further on what it really does. At this all eyes go to Rex who is standing there staring at the ground his face blank. |

#### Chapter 8: Trust and Betrayal
Rex undergoes the biochip removal, leading to major developments in Ahsoka’s investigation.

| Scenes | Description |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Rex’s Choice | Staring at Rex with baited breath, all are silent for a minute before Anakin speaks up. He asks if they really plan to remove the chip from Rex's head once they confirmed there even was one to begin with. Ahsoka and Kix look at one another for a moment unsure of what to tell him. He seems to have gotten an answer from that action as he just looks at them wide-eyed. Ahsoka has never seen him this perplexed at the prospect of their - admittedly - not well thought out plan. He asks if they had made any precautions to what would happen if the procedure had complications. If they could rule out any of the dangers involved and if they knew for sure, that he would not maybe go insane just as the reports say Tup did. The room was eerily silent. Anakin just shook his head looking at Ahsoka with some sort of wonder and disappointment. He tells them, that he is on board with this whole investigation, because he feels like he ows it to Fives, Tup and all the other clones to look into it. To keep more save to whatever happened to these two, so it may never happen again. That he wants to know what is going on just as much as they do, but that he is not ready to accept the possibility of Rex getting hurt or even dying over it. Ahsoka's eyes go down on that. It isn't like she hadn't thought about the possibility, the possible cost this whole undertaking might have in the end. But seeing Anakin look at her like with disappointment and lack of understanding stirs something in her. She feels her heart sink at that. She does not want him to look at her like that, but what should they do? Wasn't this the only way to continue and in the end, wasn't it Rex's own decision what he would wan to do after they found the chip. At this Rex looks up and lays a hand on Anakin's shoulder, who looks at him with wonder. He tells him, that he is thankful for his worry and compassion, that any clone in the GAR would have been in good hands with him as their general, as they could feel save and valued. After a short pause he continues saying, that he shares his concerns and he talked them through with Kix beforehand on what the chances might be for failure or irreversible damage and that it certainly is not zero. He tells them, that he thought about it for a long time. That he fought with himself on what to do, but that he came to one final conclusion. That he would do it, if there was such a chip. All eyes are on him as they widen and look into Rex's only to see his resolve reflected there. He says that he ows this much to Fives and Tup, as they died for whatever this is. He looks at Ahsoka and says with a controlled voice that he trusts Fives and that he trusts her gut. Both of them had brought up suspicions and Fives had died trying to warn them. He said he is ready for whatever comes, if this can save his brothers from more unnecessary harm, than he will do it, no questions asked. The room grows silent again as all of them can hear Anakin mutter a silent "Fuck", before laying a hand on Rex's shoulder too. He says that it is his decision and that the Anakin from before would have fought him over it, as he still believed it too risky with what little they actually know for sure. But that he will stand by him if he goes through with it. That he will be there for him, after all he did wrong in the past. Rex smiled slightly and Ahsoka beamed, but she still felt Anakin's cold eyes on her from before and decided on the spot, that she never wanted to feel them again. They felt dead and angry. If she would put a word to it, they almost felt like the dark side, what she felt when she fought Ventress. But Anakin would never go there. She faintly remembers a scene which must have happened a long time ago. She can only remember parts and pieces. Feelings and impressions. She can remember yellow eyes instead of the gentle blues Anakin had now. A white face with red stripes, hollow eyes and a cold voice whispering into her ear. She can remember feeling free and powerful yet lost and hatred. So much hatred. She was fearful of what Anakin had become. What she had become. But that memory could not be real. He is here with her now. Maybe not fine, but not lost to the dark side like he was in her memory. She must have dreamt it. Kix claps in his hands gaining the attention of all the people present, all of whom seemed to have zoned out into their own respective thoughts and memories. He tells them, that he doesn't want to interrupt their musings, but that they just should check for the biochip's existence first, before thinking of the worst cases and what ifs. All could agree with that and walked over to the makeshift medical space, which has been build for them in a secluded corner of Ahsoka's workspace. Kix unceremoniously pushes Rex into the chair there, soliciting a grunt from the Captain as well as some small chuckles from Anakin and Ahsoka, who share a silent moment looking at each other once again. The cold eyes, which had stirred the discontent in Ahsoka only moments before, had been replaced with his gentle albeit still slightly matted and dulled eyes. She felt relieve at that and smiled at him, which he returned in kind. Kix had pulled up some medical equipment in the mean time while telling Rex he should lie down and relax as much as he can, as he would scan his head now and for this he should stay as still as he could. Rex nods and lays back in the chair, as Kix lets it down until he ends in a lying position. Ahsoka and Anakin step to either side of Rex as Kix pulls up a medical droid as he tips into a terminal with a monitor attached. The droid moves closer to Rex and extends a little arm which promptly produces a little energie field which it moves from his chin past his scalp. Kix grumbles back at Rex, that he told him to stay still, that the scan would be unusable if he moved around too much. Anakin walks next to Rex who began to stir a bit once the droid came close, unconformable by what it does to him and the implications of the scan. As Rex mutters an apology to Kix Anakin stands next to him and places a hand on the captains shoulder pouring some calm into him through the force. This immediately removes the creases which have formed on the clones forehead and his stirring stops. Kix nods as he let's the droid scan the head of Rex again, while Ahsoka beams at Anakin's back as he had closed his eyes and used the force to keep his friend calm and collected. It warmed her heart to see. The compassion she knew Anakin possessed. That it hadn't been lost to bad memories and pain. she moves her attention back to the monitor in front of her and Kix as they both began to search for anything out of the ordinary on the image. Any difference in biological matter, any difference in electrical activity, anything they could think of. But they could not find anything. Kix sighs as he reveals to Anakin and Rex that they cannot find anything within his head which which was not supposed to be there, least of which a biochip. Ahsoka begins to think hard as she contemplates having made an error. She had been so sure and even now she can slightly feel the force hum in the back of her mind, telling her that something is wrong. Right as Kix is about to stop the scan, Anakin speaks up. He still is standing next to Rex and holding onto his shoulder, eyes closed. He tells Kix to wait, that he is sure that he can feel something within Rex's head. |
