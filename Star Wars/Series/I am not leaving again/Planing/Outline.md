## Theme and Concept

| Main Theme |
| :------- |
| The story explores redemption and self-discovery for Ahsoka and Anakin, with each of them facing the consequences of past choices and discovering their own paths forward. It’s about finding inner peace and healing through relationships, challenging institutional beliefs of the republic and the jedi order, and discovering self-worth and autonomy in the face of regret and societal expectations. |

| Secondary Theme |
| :------- |
| This theme plays out through Ahsoka’s struggle for independence and Anakin’s need for acceptance and love. Their contrasting experiences with attachment — Ahsoka’s desire to help without losing herself, and Anakin’s journey to not define his worth through others’ expectations — highlight the importance of balancing love with personal identity. |

| Concept |

| In a galaxy on the brink of war, Ahsoka and Anakin reunite at their lowest, each bearing unresolved guilt and wounded loyalty.

| Pressure from Palpatine |

Sensing a threat to his plan, he increases his influence over the Jedi Council and tries to speed up his timeline, setting up the confrontation sooner than anticipated. |

| Climax of Arc 2 |
| :------- |
| Palpatine’s manipulations come to a head, and Ahsoka and Anakin stand up to the Council in a pivotal confrontation. They question the Jedi’s unyielding stance on attachment and are nearly expelled. However, they gain the quiet support of key figures like Obi-Wan, Rex, and even Yoda, who begins to understand the Order’s failures. |

 |

### Slow-Burn Romance Development

- **Arc 1:** Ahsoka and Anakin begin rediscovering their bond as friends, with subtle hints of romantic tension.
- **Arc 2:** They face moments of vulnerability, moving closer through shared experiences and emotional support.
- **Arc 3:** Their feelings culminate in open confession and mutual acceptance, transforming their relationship into a source of strength for the climax.

## Supporting Subplots and Characters

1. **Obi-Wan’s Arc:** Obi-Wan’s evolving views on the Jedi Order parallel the primary arcs. He begins to question the Order’s rigid stance on attachment and emotion, gradually becoming an ally in the movement for change and ultimately defending Ahsoka and Anakin’s unconventional approaches.
2. **Rex and the 501st:** Rex’s loyalty and friendship become crucial as he assists Ahsoka and Anakin in their investigation and resistance against Palpatine. His role as a leader in the 501st and his decision to remove the biochip from himself (and later, from his troops) highlight the importance of trust and chosen bonds, which transcend traditional Jedi teachings.
3. **Padmé’s Influence:** Padmé’s presence complicates the budding romance, causing Ahsoka to confront feelings of jealousy and doubt while reminding Anakin of his past attachments. Over time, Padmé’s perspective shifts, and she comes to accept Ahsoka’s role in Anakin’s life, allowing Anakin and Ahsoka’s relationship to deepen without lingering guilt or unresolved feelings.
4. **Biochip Investigation:** Sparked by the suspicious death of Fives, Ahsoka and Rex embark on a journey to uncover the truth about the biochips implanted in the clones. Through careful investigation, they reveal the chips’ sinister purpose and begin covert removal operations among the 501st and the 212th battalions, ultimately driving Palpatine to accelerate his plans for Order 66. This subplot provides crucial resistance and paves the way for the clones’ loyalty during the final battle.
5. **The Jedi Council and Tradition vs. Change:** Ahsoka and Anakin’s defiance forces the Jedi Council to confront its long-standing policies on attachment, loyalty, and flexibility in Jedi conduct. Tensions arise as the Council issues ultimatums and scrutinizes their actions, while Obi-Wan, Yoda, and even Mace Windu wrestle with these challenges, representing the Council’s internal struggle. By the end, the Council begins a shift toward a more balanced view, influenced by Ahsoka and Anakin’s actions.
6. **Slow-Burn Romance Between Ahsoka and Anakin:** Their evolving feelings serve as an essential subplot, developing gradually from mutual support into an intimate, profound love. Key moments of vulnerability, shared resolve, and self-discovery highlight their romance, which becomes a source of strength and mutual redemption. This arc subtly mirrors the main themes of independence, self-worth, and trust, adding emotional depth to the story.

## Chapters
The chapter outlines for the different arcs.

### Arc 1: Reconnection and Reflection
**Objective:** Reestablish Ahsoka and Anakin’s connection, initiate the emotional and thematic threads around independence and redemption, and set up the biochip subplot with Ahsoka and Rex’s investigation into Fives’ death.

#### Chapter 1: Reunion
Ahsoka returns to find Anakin, initially encountering resistance but eventually reconnecting with him.

| Scenes | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Arrival at the Temple | Ahsoka arrives at the Jedi Temple, asking for Anakin. She faces the guarded bureaucracy of the Jedi but is helped by Obi-Wan and taken by him inside to talk about Anakin's fate. |
| Scene 2 - Discussion with Obi-Wan | Obi-Wan takes Ahsoka back to his chambers and they talk about Anakin's decline after Ahsoka left, his wife Padmé left him and he endangered his troops. She feels responsible and both she and Obi-Wan blame themselves. They also rekindle their relationship somewhat, talking about themselves and what happened to them. Obi-Wan reveals, that he has the current location of Anakin and entrusts her with finding him as he himself does not feel like the right person to do that right now. They hug, he gives her his personal Com-Channel and Ahsoka makes her way to the lower levels. |
| Scene 3 - Journey to the lower Levels | Ahsoka makes her way down and has a run in with a unfriendly warden of the motel Anakin supposedly stays at, ogling and warning her about what she may find, as it sounded like bloody murder from his room last night. She makes her way to his room and enters with the force as nobody opens to her announcements. Fearing what she may find she goes to the living room and opens it. There she finds a Anakin, seemingly broken, drunk and depressed. His robotic arm malfunctioning. Giving her goosebumps at the sight. |
| Scene 4 - First Encounter | Ahsoka cannot believe what she sees and tries to speak to Anakin. At first he does not acknowledge her and asks her to leave. She understands that he thinks she is a hallucination, as he talks about seeing her before and her never being real. He says shes better off without him and that she shouldn't be here. To this Ahsoka breaks into tears and rams into him, hugging him. He recognizes she is real and they cry for a moment together. Ahsoka says she wants to help him, but Anakin is dismissive and doesn't want any help. Ahsoka is left speechless at his stubbornness and his continuing drinking. |

#### Chapter 2: Tension
Anakin begins opening up to Ahsoka, showing cracks in his defenses as she persists.

| Scenes | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Clearance of mind | Ahsoka doesn't get further with Anakin, as he does not want to leave or have any help from her or anybody else, closing himself off. She steps outside for a minute to "get some air" telling him, that he cannot blame himself for everything, that he should not punish himself for everything that happened, that he also deserves to heal. As she steps outside she gets ready to call Obi-Wan for some help in the matter. |
| Scene 2 - Flashback | After Ahsoka stepped outside Anakin feels the dread of being alone in the room, feeling it close in on him again. Deserves to heal? not blame himself? But he is responsible. Everything is his fault. At that he enters a flashback of the mission, which was the end of his jedi ways. Padmé had left him and he became sloppier and sloppier, as he went about his missions. Not able to concentrate. Rex asked him if he was alright. He lied as always. The mission commenced and he can faintly remember someone warning him of a possible trap, but he didn't listen. Everyone died. But Rex, his medic and himself. He feels the crushing guilt as he sits for days at Rex's side. As Rex awakes, he tells him sorry and that he is going to resign. Before Rex can say anything Anakin leaves. |
| Scene 3 - Obi-Wan’s Support | After leaving Anakin, Ahsoka has a quiet, reflective conversation with Obi-Wan. He subtly encourages her persistence, hinting at his own concerns for Anakin. She tells him of his state and how he refuses to accept her help. Obi-Wan is noticeably disturbed by this news, but helps her calm down, as he talks her through some breathing techniques. He tells her, that Anakin is at a place he thinks he deserves. That he will not be easily swayed or helped. That she cannot change the things as they are right this moment. Ahsoka knows he is right, but she doesn't like that. Obi-Wan affirms that he does not like it either. But that Anakin will need her. She tells him, that he is needed as well, to which he just smiles and says that he is needed too, but not right now, not in Anakin's current state. He tells her to keep trying and make Anakin feel that she means it and will not leave. She agrees and the call ends. |
| Scene 4 - Ahsoka's decision | As Ahsoka steps back inside, Anakin is still sitting like she left him; dissociated like when she found him initially. She can feel his tenseness over their bond, but she can also see it in real live as he sweats and clutches the stool he is sitting on. She comes close to him quietly and sits before him, taking his hands in hers, as she can see his eyes become clear and unclouded again. She asks him what he saw. But he refuses, trying to pull his hands away, as the flashes of his masters eyes looking down on him jolt through him. She keeps her hands on his and makes him look in her eyes questioningly. She tells him, that she understands that he will not accept her and her help right away. But that she will stay and look after him, if he wants it or not. She will stay close. |

#### Chapter 3: Cracks in the Armour
Anakin begins opening up to Ahsoka, showing cracks in his defenses as she persists.

| Scenes | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Scene 1 - Ahsoka’s Determination | Ahsoka spends the day around Anakin, refusing to leave. They don't talk much, as Anakin is refusing to acknowledge her more than he has to. He keeps drinking. He can feel Ahsoka's glare at that, but he doesn't budge and she soon relents. She sits around him, walks around meditates and sometimes she even leans against him as she pulls up a chair next to his and just leans at his side. They don't talk, but it feels nice to have her around, even if he wouldn't tell her that, but she can feel it through their bond. In his state, he isn't the best to hide his feelings. To lighten the mood, as she cannot longer hold on in this silence, she begins reminiscing about the Clone Wars and what they went through together. They talk about their first mission together, as she was becoming his Padawan on Christophsis. How they used to compete with everything, much to the annoyance of Obi-Wan and sometimes even Rex. The moment they threw Rex off a turret wall. To this Anakin becomes somewhat sombre. |
| Scene 2 - First Signs of Vulnerability | Talking about all of this, results in a moment of vulnerability of Anakin, as he reveals hints of guilt and self-doubt as he talks about having failed Rex and the 501st. To which Ahsoka does not say anything, wanting to let him vent, if he wants to. He instead goes on to also say, that he failed her. She wants to rebuke it, but he stops her. He talks about her leaving the temple and how that made him feel. That he doesn't blame her, but that he felt as if he lost something of himself and he failed her. She says what she felt and talks a bit about the guild she feels and that she also feels the same about having lost a piece of her. They both have a charged silent moment as they look at each other. She still sitting next to him, as their hands slowly come closer to one another again, as are their bodies. Until a sound pulls them back from it. |
| Scene 3 - Padmé’s Presence | Pulled from the moment Anakin groans at the sound, to which Ahsoka asks, what it is. He says that it is his private comlink, which means it only can be Padmé calling him. He continues that after he has left the order and went out of sight, Padmé regularly blows up his comlink and that he really would rather talk to a Hutt's behind, than to her right now and takes a big swig out off his bottle making him cough, to no reaction of help or pity of Ahsoka. She on the other hand feels a strange singe at the mention of Padmé. She feels guilty about leaving Anakin, but Padmé also hurt him. Badly. She left him, her own husband. She cannot explain the destain she feels for a women she had considered her friend before. But she cannot stop herself asking, if she may talk to Padmé. To which Anakin once again chokes on his sip. He coughs and asks her why. To which Ahsoka just gives him a look, which he seems to understand. Without a word he pulls out the comlink from under a pile of dirty clothes and gives it to her, much to her ick and his amusement. She walks into the corridor, closing the door and takes the call. Padmé starts ecstatic, thinking she finally got Ani on the line, but soon realizes that Ahsoka is staring back at her without a word. She begins unbelieving and happy to see Ahsoka again, as Ahsoka battles with different emotions on her own. |
