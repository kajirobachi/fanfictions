| Background |
| :------- |
| A former Jedi Padawan of Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka fought in the Clone Wars and became renowned for her bravery, insight, and unconventional approach to battle and diplomacy. After being falsely accused of treason and subsequently acquitted, she chose to leave the Jedi Order to forge her own path, feeling betrayed by those she trusted most. Her departure left a lasting impact on her, forcing her to confront her identity and beliefs outside the Jedi framework. She has since had to redefine herself outside the Order, carrying complex feelings about her past, the Jedi, and her bond with Anakin. |

| Strengths | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Empathy | Ahsoka connects deeply with others, which gives her strong emotional insight, making her a natural healer and comfort to those suffering. |
| Adaptability | She’s resourceful and quick to adjust her tactics and behavior, even when faced with unfamiliar challenges outside the Order. |
| Conviction | Ahsoka has a strong moral compass and acts on her beliefs, often against her own interests if it’s the right thing to do. |

| Weaknesses | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Stubbornness | While loyal, Ahsoka’s dedication can turn into single-mindedness, occasionally causing her to push herself or others beyond healthy limits. |
|Self-Doubt | Leaving the Jedi Order planted seeds of guilt and self-questioning, especially concerning her relationships with Anakin and Obi-Wan. Her independence sometimes makes her hesitant to ask for help or reconnect with former allies. |
| Attachment | Despite the Jedi’s teachings, she forms strong attachments that can make her vulnerable, especially with people she considers family, with a relationship growing more complex like with Anakin. Her attachment to Anakin has evolved from mentor-student loyalty to something deeper and more complex. This growing connection might blur her ability to remain objective and increase her vulnerability. |

| Internal Conflicts |
| :------- |
| Ahsoka feels the weight of her choice to leave Anakin behind, sensing it contributed to his downward spiral. She wrestles with guilt, fearing that her departure weakened him. She’s torn between honoring her need for independence and her wish to be there for those she loves, even if they’re on self-destructive paths. | 
| The possibility of romance complicates Ahsoka’s sense of independence and self-worth. She may question whether her deepening feelings for Anakin are healthy or if they undermine her purpose. Balancing her desire to help him with her need for self-growth adds a layer of tension and self-discovery. |

| Mannerisms/Quirks |
| :------- |
| Tends to cross her arms or fidget when uncertain. | 
| Often gives a slight, rueful smile when recounting tough or painful memories, a sign of her resilience and self-awareness. |
| Her subtle, shy smiles or quiet laughter in Anakin’s presence could hint at her conflicting emotions. |

## Relationships and Bonds

| Anakin Skywalker | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Relationship | Anakin was her master, mentor, and friend. He’s now someone who awakens deeper, more vulnerable feelings in her as she sees him at his lowest. Their bond has become both a source of strength and a point of emotional complexity for Ahsoka. Anakin’s protective and slightly reckless approach to both war and their relationship shaped Ahsoka’s outlook, making her both fond of and somewhat wary of his passionate nature. Her bond with him is deep and complex, and she’s instinctively able to sense his emotional and physical state through the Force. |
| Conflict | Ahsoka’s growing romantic feelings for Anakin clash with her previous mentor-student bond, which was built on loyalty and trust. She feels the weight of her choice to leave him behind, fearing it contributed to his downfall, and is torn between supporting him and maintaining her independence. |
| Force Bond | The Force bond with Anakin remains strong, even after her departure. Ahsoka can sense his emotions and presence from a distance, which she describes in the story as feeling “brittle” or “strained.” This bond tugs at her heart, reminding her of the role she played in his life and his impact on her, even after months apart. Their bond is now more dynamic, carrying not only loyalty but also a budding romantic energy. The strength of the bond sometimes overwhelms Ahsoka, making it difficult to distinguish her emotions from his. This intense connection could lead her to moments of vulnerability, where she’s unsure if her actions come from a place of love or obligation.|

| Obi-Wan Kenobi | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Relationship | Obi-Wan was both a mentor and friend, providing her with guidance and a perspective less impulsive than Anakin’s. She holds a complicated respect for him; though she recognizes his role in her condemnation, she understands he acted out of duty. He offers her an objective perspective, often reminding her of the need for balance and her own autonomy. |
| Conflict | She forgave him long ago but is still disappointed in the rigidity of the Jedi Order he represents. Despite this, she values his friendship and guidance, seeking him out when she feels lost. Their relationship is grounded in mutual respect, yet Obi-Wan’s concern for her attachment to Anakin might create some tension between them. |

## Goals and Motivations

| Primary Goal |
| :------- |
| To reconnect with Anakin, help him heal, and confront her own unresolved feelings. Her primary aim is to help him reclaim his strength and purpose, yet she’s also driven by her emerging feelings, which she’s hesitant to fully accept. |

| Secondary Goal(s) | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Understanding What Happened | Seeking clarity on Anakin’s descent gives her a stronger sense of purpose in the journey, ensuring she’s helping him for the right reasons. |
| Self-Forgiveness | On a deeper level, Ahsoka’s journey with Anakin is also about forgiving herself for leaving and finding a way to balance her independence with her commitment to those she loves. Ahsoka seeks to reconcile her past decisions and find peace, letting go of guilt and self-blame. |

| Motivations |
| :------- |
| Loyalty and love drive Ahsoka, but she’s also motivated by a desire to grow personally, understanding that her journey with Anakin is as much about her as it is about him. She is willing to face her feelings to be there for him, but she knows that their healing must be mutual. |

## Arc and Development

| Initial State |
| :------- |
| When Ahsoka enters the story, she’s in a tense, unsettled state, feeling the pull to reconnect with her past. She’s carrying guilt but also a newfound confidence from the time she’s spent outside the Order. She’s ready to confront her mistakes but is also nervous about seeing Anakin’s true state. |

| Potential Changes |
| :------- |
| Ahsoka may need to confront her guilt directly, recognizing that she can’t change Anakin’s choices. This journey could lead her toward self-acceptance and help her understand that she can be there for him without sacrificing her own path. |
| Ahsoka may need to learn to embrace vulnerability, both in her growing feelings and in allowing Anakin to rely on her. Her growth would involve recognizing that love doesn’t have to be a weakness and that mutual support can strengthen rather than weaken her independence. |
| Empathy and Patience. As she helps Anakin, she might learn new forms of patience, discovering ways to help him without forcing her ideals upon him. This would show her growth from the passionate Padawan to a wise, compassionate friend or more. |
| Accepting her feelings for Anakin and finding a balance between love and independence could lead her to a point where she’s at peace with whatever future their relationship holds. |  

| Key Turning Points | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Meeting Anakin in the Lower Levels | Ahsoka seeing Anakin’s broken state brings a powerful wave of guilt, anger, and sorrow that will likely shape her actions going forward. |
| Accepting Responsibility, but Letting Go | There may come a moment when Ahsoka has to let Anakin make his own choices, even if that means letting him struggle without her interference. This might be painful, but it will reinforce her independence and respect for Anakin’s autonomy. |
| An Emotional Confession | A critical point may come when Ahsoka admits her feelings, either directly or in a tense moment, revealing to Anakin how deeply she cares for him and is willing to stand by him. This could serve as a catalyst for both of their arcs. |
| Making a Difficult Choice | Ahsoka may face a moment where she has to choose between pursuing a relationship with Anakin and allowing him to heal on his own, a realization that her love doesn’t mean she must control the outcome. |

## Canon Consistency and Story Adaptations

| Core Canon Traits |
| :------- |
| Ahsoka is defined by her compassion, courage, and loyalty, even if it sometimes conflicts with her independence. She often defies rules when they go against her morals, and she’s deeply affected by her experiences during the Clone Wars. |
| Ahsoka’s courage, compassion, and loyalty remain central, but her romantic feelings for Anakin add a new, tender dimension. Her independence is balanced with the vulnerability of her emerging emotions. |

| Adaptations |
| :------- |
| In this story, her growth is less about defying the Order and more about reconciling her past decisions and seeing herself as someone who can still help, even from the outside. Her guilt and need for Anakin’s well-being make her vulnerable, but she’s more emotionally mature, carrying an almost maternal instinct for his well-being. |
| This version of Ahsoka experiences a softer, more vulnerable side as she realizes her romantic feelings for Anakin. This gentle evolution respects her canon strength while also expanding her emotional depth, showing how love can coexist with autonomy. |

## Notes on Scene Interactions

| Each interaction with Anakin will likely test her patience, compassion, and emotional resilience. Small details, like physical touches or Ahsoka’s urge to comfort him, can make these scenes potent and reflective of their history. Moments of unspoken tension, quiet vulnerability, or almost-confessions can reflect Ahsoka’s inner struggle and the warmth that grows between them. |

| Scenes with Obi-Wan |
| :------- |
| Obi-Wan’s role as a bridge between Ahsoka and Anakin creates opportunities for him to challenge Ahsoka’s beliefs, while Ahsoka’s reflections on the Order can nudge him toward self-reflection too. They might share a somber camaraderie, bound by their concern for Anakin. |
| Obi-Wan might serve as a grounding presence for Ahsoka, offering advice or caution when he notices her attachment. He may gently remind her of the need for balance, highlighting her struggle between her feelings and her sense of responsibility. |
