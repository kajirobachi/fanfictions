| Background |
| :------- |
| A former Jedi Padawan of Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka fought in the Clone Wars and became renowned for her bravery, insight, and unconventional approach to battle and diplomacy. After being falsely accused of treason and subsequently acquitted, she chose to leave the Jedi Order to forge her own path, feeling betrayed by those she trusted most.

| Adaptability | She’s resourceful and quick to adjust her tactics and behavior, even when faced with unfamiliar challenges outside the Order. |
| Conviction | Ahsoka has a strong moral compass and acts on her beliefs, often against her own interests if it’s the right thing to do. |

| Weaknesses | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Stubbornness | While loyal, Ahsoka’s dedication can turn into single-mindedness, occasionally causing her to push herself or others beyond healthy limits. |
|Self-Doubt | Leaving the Jedi Order planted seeds of guilt and self-questioning, especially concerning her relationships with Anakin and Obi-Wan. Her independence sometimes makes her hesitant to ask for help or reconnect with former allies. |
| Attachment | Despite the Jedi’s teachings, she forms strong attachments that can make her vulnerable, especially with people she considers family, with a relationship growing more complex like with Anakin. |

| Internal Conflicts |
| :------- |
| Ahsoka feels the weight of her choice to leave Anakin behind, sensing it contributed to his downward spiral. She wrestles with guilt, fearing that her departure weakened him. She’s torn between honoring her need for independence and her wish to be there for those she loves, even if they’re on self-destructive paths. |

## Relationships and Bonds

| Anakin Skywalker | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Relationship | Ahsoka’s former master, mentor, and almost an older brother figure. Anakin’s protective and slightly reckless approach to both war and their relationship shaped Ahsoka’s outlook, making her both fond of and somewhat wary of his passionate nature. Her bond with him is deep and complex, and she’s instinctively able to sense his emotional and physical state through the Force. |
| Conflict | Though she left the Order partly to escape its corruption, she has lingering guilt about abandoning Anakin, particularly knowing how he depended on her as a grounding force. This sense of unfinished business drives her return in the story, unable to ignore their connection even after months of distance. |
| Force Bond | The Force bond with Anakin remains strong, even after her departure. Ahsoka can sense his emotions and presence from a distance, which she describes in the story as feeling “brittle” or “strained.” This bond tugs at her heart, reminding her of the role she played in his life and his impact on her, even after months apart. |

| Obi-Wan Kenobi | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Relationship | Obi-Wan was both a mentor and friend, providing her with guidance and a perspective less impulsive than Anakin’s. She holds a complicated respect for him; though she recognizes his role in her condemnation, she understands he acted out of duty. |
| Conflict | She forgave him long ago but is still disappointed in the rigidity of the Jedi Order he represents. Despite this, she values his friendship and guidance, seeking him out when she feels lost. |

## Goals and Motivations

| Primary Goal |
| :------- |
| To reconnect with Anakin and help him find his way back from despair and isolation. Ahsoka feels it’s her duty to repair the bond and be the support he lost. |

| Secondary Goal(s) | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Understanding What Happened | She wants to learn the full story of Anakin’s downfall, seeking out Obi-Wan to fill in the gaps and find the best way to reach him. |
| Self-Forgiveness | On a deeper level, Ahsoka’s journey with Anakin is also about forgiving herself for leaving and finding a way to balance her independence with her commitment to those she loves. |

| Motivations |
| :------- |
| Her love and loyalty for Anakin drive her, as well as a sense of unfinished business. She feels responsible for him, knowing that he’s on a destructive path partly due to her absence. |

## Arc and Development

| Initial State |
| :------- |
| When Ahsoka enters the story, she’s in a tense, unsettled state, feeling the pull to reconnect with her past. She’s carrying guilt but also a newfound confidence from the time she’s spent outside the Order. She’s ready to confront her mistakes but is also nervous about seeing Anakin’s true state. |

| Potential Changes |
| :------- |
| Ahsoka may need to confront her guilt directly, recognizing that she can’t change Anakin’s choices. This journey could lead her toward self-acceptance and help her understand that she can be there for him without sacrificing her own path. |
| Empathy and Patience. As she helps Anakin, she might learn new forms of patience, discovering ways to help him without forcing her ideals upon him. This would show her growth from the passionate Padawan to a wise, compassionate friend. |  

| Key Turning Points | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Meeting Anakin in the Lower Levels | Ahsoka seeing Anakin’s broken state brings a powerful wave of guilt, anger, and sorrow that will likely shape her actions going forward. |
| Accepting Responsibility, but Letting Go | There may come a moment when Ahsoka has to let Anakin make his own choices, even if that means letting him struggle without her interference. This might be painful, but it will reinforce her independence and respect for Anakin’s autonomy. |

## Canon Consistency and Story Adaptations

| Core Canon Traits |
| :------- |
| Ahsoka is defined by her compassion, courage, and loyalty, even if it sometimes conflicts with her independence. She often defies rules when they go against her morals, and she’s deeply affected by her experiences during the Clone Wars. |

| Adaptations |
| :------- |
| In this story, her growth is less about defying the Order and more about reconciling her past decisions and seeing herself as someone who can still help, even from the outside. Her guilt and need for Anakin’s well-being make her vulnerable, but she’s more emotionally mature, carrying an almost maternal instinct for his well-being. |

## Notes on Scene Interactions

| Scenes with Anakin |
| :------- |
| Each interaction with Anakin will likely test her patience, compassion, and emotional resilience. Small details, like physical touches or Ahsoka’s urge to comfort him, can make these scenes potent and reflective of their history. |

| Scenes with Obi-Wan |
| :------- |
| Obi-Wan’s role as a bridge between Ahsoka and Anakin creates opportunities for him to challenge Ahsoka’s beliefs, while Ahsoka’s reflections on the Order can nudge him toward self-reflection too. They might share a somber camaraderie, bound by their concern for Anakin. |
