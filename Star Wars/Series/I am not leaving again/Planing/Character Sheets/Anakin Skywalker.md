| Weaknesses | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Self-Loathing | Anakin is prone to extreme guilt and self-punishment, viewing his mistakes as fundamental flaws that define his worth. |
| Fear of Loss | Anakin’s fear of losing loved ones drives many of his decisions. He’s terrified of abandonment, which often leads him to make impulsive or self-destructive choices. |
| Difficulty with Vulnerability | While Anakin feels emotions deeply, he resists showing weakness. This makes it hard for him to accept help, especially from those he cares about, as he fears disappointing them. |

| Internal Conflicts |
| :------- |
| Anakin’s self-worth is heavily shaped by his failures, and he struggles to see himself as worthy of love or forgiveness. This inner conflict keeps him from moving forward, as he fixates on punishment rather than healing. |

| Mannerisms/Quirks |
| :------- |
| When anxious or feeling exposed, he tends to clench his mechanical hand or avoid eye contact. |
| He also has a habit of withdrawing into himself when someone tries to comfort him, particularly if he feels undeserving of their support. |
| He rather tries to joke than to let the severity of the situation he is in be seen. |

## Relationships and Bonds

| Ahsoka Tano | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Relationship | Anakin and Ahsoka share a deep connection, with Ahsoka being one of the few people who truly understands his complexities. He sees her as both a former student and close friend, although her reappearance stirs conflicting emotions within him. |
| Conflict | Anakin’s growing romantic feelings for Ahsoka challenge his belief that he’s unworthy of love, forcing him to confront his insecurities. He worries about dragging her down with him or disappointing her. Yet, her presence gradually helps him see himself through her eyes, revealing parts of himself he thought were lost. |
| Force Bond | Anakin and Ahsoka share a strong Force bond that persists despite their physical distance and time apart. Ahsoka’s reappearance and her steady emotional presence challenge his instinct to shut people out. Their bond amplifies his emotions and often draws him back to a place of vulnerability and openness, especially when Ahsoka uses it to reach him in times of need. |

| Obi-Wan Kenobi | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Relationship | Once Anakin’s mentor and friend, Obi-Wan represents the Jedi values that Anakin now feels alienated from. Although he still cares for Obi-Wan, Anakin is haunted by the guilt of feeling like a disappointment, and he tends to withdraw from him to avoid facing that reminder. He also has never fully forgiven him or the council for instigating Obi-Wan's death and leaving him in the dark, which complicate his feelings of guilt even more. |
| Conflict | Anakin’s mixed feelings toward Obi-Wan stem from his admiration and guilt. He sees Obi-Wan as a model Jedi but feels he’s let him down. This fuels Anakin’s self-loathing, and he struggles to accept Obi-Wan’s attempts to reach out to him. |

## Goals and Motivations

| Primary Goal |
| :------- |
| Though he begins with no clear goal beyond isolating himself, Anakin’s journey gradually shifts toward seeking self-acceptance. With Ahsoka’s influence, he reluctantly confronts the idea that he doesn’t need to “deserve” love or forgiveness to start healing. |

| Secondary Goal(s) | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Breaking Free from Self-Destruction | Anakin doesn’t initially want help, but as he reconnects with Ahsoka, he begins to hope that life might offer him something beyond punishment. He slowly works to find a path that isn’t defined solely by his failures. |
| Rediscovering His Purpose | Once Anakin starts to release some of his guilt, he may seek a new way to contribute to the world, even if it’s outside of the Jedi Order. This purpose would help ground his healing, giving him a way to channel his power constructively. |

| Motivations |
| :------- |
| Anakin is driven by a mix of guilt and an underlying fear that he’s destined to hurt those close to him. However, Ahsoka’s compassion starts to challenge this belief, creating an internal struggle as he faces the possibility that he could still be worthy of redemption and love. |

## Arc and Development

| Initial State |
| :------- |
| Anakin begins the story in a state of despair, rejecting others’ help and deeply convinced that he deserves his suffering. His self-worth is at an all-time low, and he uses isolation as both punishment and protection. He initially resists Ahsoka’s attempts to help him, seeing them as unearned kindness. |

| Potential Changes |
| :------- |
| With Ahsoka’s presence and the gradual buildup of trust, Anakin begins to accept support without immediately shutting it out. This shift allows him to explore the idea of forgiveness, though he’s cautious and hesitant. |
| By confronting past traumas with Ahsoka’s guidance, he starts to believe that he’s more than his mistakes. He learns that growth and redemption are possible, even for someone as damaged as he feels he is. |
| Anakin’s growth culminates in his willingness to see a future for himself beyond punishment. While he might not fully embrace optimism, he moves toward a life where he can contribute and connect without being defined by guilt alone. |

| Key Turning Points | |
| :------- | :------ |
| Opening Up to Ahsoka | A critical moment arises when Anakin allows himself to share a deeply painful memory with Ahsoka, symbolizing his willingness to be seen and supported rather than retreating in shame. |
| A Moment of Redemption | A scenario where Anakin actively saves or helps someone else could reinforce his worth and potential, showing him that he still has a positive impact on others. |

## Canon Consistency and Story Adaptations

| Core Canon Traits |
| :------- |
| Anakin’s intensity, loyalty, and struggle with inner darkness remain central to his character. His attachment to others and tendency toward guilt-driven self-punishment are key to his identity. |

| Adaptations |
| :------- |
| In this story, Anakin’s self-loathing is intensified by recent losses and isolation. The difference here is that he’s forced to confront these feelings directly through his interactions with Ahsoka, rather than allowing them to fester unaddressed. This adaptation allows for a more introspective journey where Anakin’s growth doesn’t come from external achievement but from inner reconciliation. |

## Notes on Scene Interactions

| Scenes with Ahsoka |
| :------- |
| Anakin’s interactions with Ahsoka would be marked by emotional hesitance and tentative vulnerability. Small actions, like Ahsoka’s reassurance or a gentle touch, could have a powerful effect on him, slowly helping him to open up. As he becomes more comfortable with her presence, he might even share moments of guarded playfulness or warmth, reflecting his gradual healing. |

| Scenes with Obi-Wan |
| :------- |
| Tension and ambivalence may characterize Anakin’s interactions with Obi-Wan. Though he respects Obi-Wan, his guilt complicates their connection. Their scenes could explore Anakin’s internal struggle between admiration and feeling unworthy, highlighting his progress as he learns to accept Obi-Wan’s friendship despite his insecurities. |
