# Planing
> [!CAUTION]
> THERE WILL BE DEFINITE SPOILERS AHEAD IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE STORY TO COMPLETION YET! Everything which will happen is planed out there, so don't blame me, if you ruin the story for yourself.

The story has been planed out beforehand, so if the story isn't finished yet or you haven't read it yet you will find information here on what will happen. You can look into my thought process of how I planed out the story and different sub-plots themes and arcs for both characters and the story itself.
