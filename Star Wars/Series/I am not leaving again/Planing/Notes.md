# Notes

- Considering that Yoda and the rest of the Jedi order never sensed that Palpatine was the Sith lord named Sidious, begs the question how that was possible.
    - Yoda and the others have a certain image of the sith and are not giving them the credit, that they could change or evolve. But that they did. The hybris and complacency of the jedi never even let them think about searching for the sith lord right in front of them. Never did they think about considering Palpatine as a threat.
    - As the Republic build Coruscant as the capital planet, they contacted the jedi and made them the protectors of the peace and of the republic. They should keep it in existence and protect its values. This inadvertently had the consequence, that the Jedi are subordinated by the senate in a certain way. They are civil servants and protectors of the republic. This Yoda wanted to protect and keep, as without it the order wouldn't exist, which results in the order not really allowing a political opinion, at least passively. 
    - Sidious together with Plagueis created a veil of darkness which should hide them and their presence from the jedi until they were ready to strike and make the final movements of their plan. This was incredibly successful and essentially made the Jedi order blind in the force, without them even noticing.
    - Mace Windu could feel certain breaks in the force and was aware of something sinister. Of a connection between Anakin, Obi-Wan and the Chancellor. He felt darkness around Palpatine, but only ever believed him to be controlled by the sith, not to be one himself. He did not get the council on his side with this till the very end, when it was too late already.
