# Chapter 1 - Reunion

“What do you mean, there’s nobody here by that name? He was my Master, of course he lives here.”

Ahsoka huffed, not even bothering to hide her frustration with this situation. Maybe it was a bad idea after all. She had known that something like this was bound to happen, that was just what business with the Jedi was now. Trouble.

But she didn’t come here for her own gratification or reconciliation with the council, she came because last night she felt the bond she still shared with her old master become brittle and almost break. It hadn’t been as strong as it had been once, but still strong enough to feel when Anakin was in some kind of trouble. But now, she only could vaguely tell that he was still alive. She knew what it would feel like if he wasn’t. Which as a prospect frightened Ahsoka. She could not fathom the possibility of the emptiness prevailing at the other end of the bond where he once was. Ahsoka could still feel the battered and ripped bond she had shared with Barriss, it throbbed and screeched in her head like a open nerve ending whenever she tried to focus on it. Having her old master gone was not an option. Their bond becoming like this was not an option. 

She had known that getting into the temple would be a challenge as the unwavering temple guard before her just so eloquently proved, but she just needed to know, needed to see her master, and determine for herself if he was okay or not. Actually, there had been many times after she left when she wanted to reach out, guilt for leaving him behind eating at her conscience and at her heart, but she never made the step. Never did she contact him in any way, not even through the force. Their bond became docile, after Anakin gave up his prodding after a while. But last night she clearly felt a shift and a strain she could not ignore anymore. After all this time, she could not ignore him or her heart anymore. Anakin was too important in her life and even if she had cut him off knowingly before, she had to reach out and stand up for her mistake. Ahsoka had to see him. Now.

She quietly fumed, thinking about how the heck she would get into the force damned temple, if the guard would not let her pass. Maybe she should scale the wall? Or climb through a vent?

“Ahsoka?” A low voice rumbled behind her making her jump a little. She had been so deeply in thought that she didn’t even feel somebody come up behind her. She slowly turned around to face the one who pulled her out of those thoughts, although his voice was all she needed to know who he was.

“Master Kenobi.” She said with a little smile pulling at her lips. He had been one of the council members that condemned her, but he still was a friend, at least she felt that way again after all the resentment for that day had passed into the void.

“Not that I would mind, I am actually quite delighted to see you again. Though… If you won’t mind me asking, why are you here?”

“Well, I… I just wanted to visit Anakin, but this guard keeps telling me that nobody by the name of Skywalker lives here.” She stated, becoming a little unsure herself why she was here exactly. After all this time and without a plan. A sad smile appeared on Obi-wan's face at that.

“As painful as it may be… he isn’t wrong. Anakin no longer…”

Ahsoka could feel her stomach drop. This couldn’t be real; this couldn’t be happening. Was he about to tell her that Anakin had died?! That her master, her friend was no more? But she could still feel him in the force even if faint. Was this just an echo of his presence? She still had so much to talk to him about and so much time she wanted to spend with him once they established some contact again and she had the opportunity to apologize for her walking out of his life like that, when she decided to leave the order. But now?

“Oh Obi-wan… did he… is he” she stuttered her mouth dry and her hands clam. Her body shook slightly her skin loosing its vibrant color by the second. She could feel her heartbeat inside her eyes as she waited for Obi-wan to confirm or deny.

Obi-wan sensing where she was headed, eagerly shook his arms and looked at her wide eyed.

“Oh no! No, he isn’t dead, at least I think he isn’t. He just… left the order.”

The stone in her heart somewhat resolved, but now the confusion was even bigger than before. Her master, left? A little giggle came over her lips before she could hold it back, just managing to not full on laugh.

“He left the order. Anakin? Anakin Skywalker, the general, destined to be the greatest Jedi,” she emphasized with a grand gesture and a booming voice, “left the order… You must be joking.”

Obi-wan just smiled at her, a real smile this time, a little bit smug as always but she liked that about him.

“I couldn’t believe it either at first, but it is the truth non the less.” 

She couldn’t feel any deceit echoing through the force, so he really was telling the truth. She was baffled and had more questions than before.

“Why… how?” she started before Obi-wan cut her off.

“I would be glad to tell you everything, but maybe at a nicer and more... private place if this is alright with you.”

She closed her still open mouth and just nodded. He smiled at her again and began to walk past her inside the temple and she followed, eyeing the temple guard. But he seemed to ignore her now, happy that she was now overlooked by one of the council members, or probably just uninterested in who she was and who she was with, as long as she didn’t do anything harmful to the temple. As much as she liked to, deep down she knew she wouldn’t.

They walked in silence, as she trotted behind him looking around the temple. It was basically the same as she remembered, nothing had changed. She could see her younger self run through those corridors and almost all corners had a memory within them. It was surreal to walk these halls again after four months of absence, but it had something familiar even inviting. Even if she knew that it just was the fact that she lived here most of her life that ached in her heart. She had no intention to return before and now that she was here, she was strengthened in that decision.

She walked on autopilot behind Obi-wan, already knowing where he was going. *So, his quarters haven’t changed either*. They made it there relatively unscathed, some funny eyes were thrown at her, not that she cared though.

“Well, come on in then.” Obi-wan gestured as he opened his door with the force and let her in before following suite. The jedi quarters could not be considered luxurious and personal things were not allowed, as was the Jedi code, but still his room always felt like home to her. She immediately relaxed after stepping inside. 

He offered her a seat that she gladly took and started to make some tea. That was one of the perks of being in the high council, the rooms were bigger and had their own little kitchen and living area, if one wanted to call it that. In reality it was just three bean bags around a little table. A book still lying on top of it. But Obi-wan cared for that long before she could get a good look at what the great Jedi master was reading in his free time, even if she could have sworn to have seen a photo of him and Queen Sateen of Mandalore as the bookmark.

Looking around she couldn’t make out anything interesting, some things she considered personal to him, but they were scares and she hadn’t much time because a big steaming cup of tea was placed before her, before she could indulge any further. It smelled wondrous, like nature or sitting in a big field of grass. She liked that. She took a sip while looking at the man before her, that just had sat down and was mimicking her actions.

They were in silence, but it wasn’t an awkward silence, rather the silence shared between friends of many years, where things could be understood without being said. As nice as this was, Obi-wan was the first to break it.

“So, how have you been after… that day? What do you do now?” He started a little remorse shining through at the mention of the day she had left.

“I am well… I think. It was a big leap, and I must say, the jedi didn’t really prepare me for what life would be without them, but I guess they usually wouldn’t have to.” She answered earnestly. Once those words would have been full of bitterness and scorn, but now they were sincere. He smiled a little at that, nodding in approval while taking another sip, pushing her to speak more.

“I was a little lost at the beginning and didn’t trust anyone, but I found some friends around the line eventually. Sisters actually, who have their own little repair shop. That’s where I live and where I work now. It isn’t much but I like it. Although breathing top air rather than fumes is a welcome change for once.” She concluded with a little chuckle. There were many more things she could tell him, but this was as far as she found necessary for now. He did not need to know all the trouble she had found herself in, or he just would have a feast teasing her for it. Of that she was sure.

As if he read her mind, he smiled mischievously, his cheekiness showing, but he didn’t press the matter further.

“I am glad that you found a path for yourself, on which you can be happy.” He said with all the sincerity he could, while squeezing her hand slightly that was lying on the table. This was kind of nice she thought, she would like to talk to him more… but there was a more important question on her mind.

“I am really sorry that I am this pushy, but what happened to my Mas… to Anakin?” she asked fidgeting with her cup a little. Obi-wan's face turned a little more serious now as he looked down and nodded.

“Yeah of course, I should tell you.” He sighed once more. “Well, after you left, he fell into a hole. He was not complete anymore. It was like one part of him had died… And it showed.”

Pain shot across her face, thinking about all the pain she had caused him, she knew she did, but at the time she had to find herself and look after herself first. Even so, she had been feeling guilty about it ever since. Maybe that was the reason she never called. Because she felt too guilty about it.

Obi-wan pulled her out of her spiralling mind, by placing his hand on hers again.

“It isn’t your fault Ahsoka. If anyone is at fault than it is me and the council, for treating you the way we did.”

He fell silent for a few moments before continuing. 

“I never got the chance, not that I deserved it, but I wanted to apologize. I can’t apologize for the council, they speak for themselves, but me, I am terribly sorry for everything that happened that day. I never intended it to come to this, not that it will help you in any way to know that, or get you to forgive me, but I wanted you to know nether the less.”

He concluded with a solemn face while retreating his hand. A strange feeling surged through Ahsoka. Where pain and guilt had been, there momentarily was warmth and happiness, it only stayed for a few moments, but it was there.

“Thank you Obi-wan, I appreciate it. And… to be honest I never was mad at you or the council. Not really. I just was and am disappointed in what the order has become, that’s the reason I left, not because I was mad at them or you. You were my master as much as Anakin was, maybe even more in some respects, so I like to say that I always thought of you as a friend and that hasn’t changed. My way has just diverged from yours and that would have happened in any case, no matter if you prosecuted me or not. If not, something else would have got me to do it.”

Obi-wan looked at her throughout her monologue his expression a mixture of sadness, understanding, happiness and something she only could describe as pure fondness.

“So, you don’t have something to blame yourself for, you didn’t make the order the way it is, and you can’t change it over a whim, and you most certainly don’t have to blame yourself because of Anakin. That is my doing I suppose. Yeah, I know, I had to go, and I had to find my place and myself, but that doesn’t necessarily include severing the ties with my master. It doesn’t mean that I couldn’t have contacted him long ago, once I was settled and had thought about all this. It didn’t mean that I had to abandon him like this. I may not have pushed him over the edge, but I walked him there to only leave him behind to stare into the abyss alone.”

“You have grown wise Ahsoka.” Obi-wan mused, “I thank you for still feeling that way about me, I can tell you, as long as I am alive, I will be your friend, that will never change. I know there is a lot of guilt for each of us concerning Anakin, but that doesn’t change the past, we cannot do that. So maybe both of us should cut back a bit on it. It is wiser to do it better now, than to wallow over what has been done.”

Ahsoka only nodded smiling at him again. The atmosphere has grown a bit more relaxed. It never had been unpleasant, but she hadn’t noticed the tenseness of it until now.

“To continue the story. Anakin was lost after you left. He threw himself into his work and into battles to not think about it. It worked for a bit, but as you can guess this didn’t fix anything. There is one thing you need to know about Anakin, before I can continue. Anakin always had been struggling to let go of personal ties, be it his mother or you or Padme.”

That piked Ahsoka’s interest, what did Padme have to do with things.

“They know each other as long as I know him, he was a little boy back then, a slave still too. Now that he left, he disclosed to me and the council that he had been in a relationship with her, a marriage to be precise.”

“Oh.” Ahsoka huffed picturing the both of them for a moment.

“You don’t seem surprised?”

“Well… I was confused when you brought her up, but when you said it, it actually made a lot of sense. This explains some things, I guess. I didn’t know specifically it just was something I always felt in a way, but I only now realize it to be true.”

A slight chuckle made it over Obi-wan's lips.

“I know what you mean, I had the exact same reaction, but the council was enraged about it.”

“I can imagine.” They shared a laugh.

“I think I always knew, even back then. Since they had met the first time, I knew that there was something, but sometimes the mind doesn’t accept what it actually knows. Well, they were married, with emphasis on the past tense. I don’t know what happened, Anakin didn’t tell me but a few months after you left, she left him for some reason and that was the point where he broke, I believe. I sadly did not notice directly, I could tell he was more upset than usual, but I thought it had to do with you or something that went wrong on the battlefield. I was too sluggish with it.” He huffed slightly.

“It seemed that after that, battle didn’t even suffice to ease his mind. After his own words, he did ‘become sloppy, unfocused and dumb’. Nothing happened for a while but at some point, there was bound for something to go wrong. He was leading a little insurrection with a few soldiers from the 501<sup>st</sup> and got ambushed. All of his man got killed but his Captain and a medic. His captain wasn’t too far away from death as well though.”

“Rex? Is he okay?”

“Yeah, he made it out, but hadn’t it been for the medic, he would have also died or at least lost his ability to walk. Anakin beat himself up over it, never leaving the bedside of his captain until he woke. Directly after he came to the council and declined his post. Before, they had already demoted him from his seat and the ability to take a Padawan after his behavior following this incident and not caring for their orders anymore. I think it didn’t even matter to him at this point. He told us everything and how responsible he felt. He ‘should have sensed the trap’ was what he said, one of his clones even pointed out the possibility of one to him beforehand, but he didn’t listen or better wasn’t able to get it, because his brain was so overloaded. He never had the peace to think clearly again. At least that is how he described it. He felt he didn’t deserve to be a Jedi anymore, to be a general leading his troops, he may as well could have killed them with his own hands. He felt he couldn’t handle the responsibility anymore, that he wasn’t worthy, that his clones would be better off in the care of somebody else, anyone else but him. And after he declared that and his declination he left. I tried to stop and talk to him, but he didn’t want to tell me where he would go, or what he would do. He just apologized to me and left.”

Obi-wan ended his story, the sadness once again returned. Ahsoka was baffled, her master always seemed to her like this unmovable force, like someone that could get through everything, but as it seemed there were things even he couldn’t recover from. Not alone at least. He thought he had to be alone, after being left by her and so many others. She had to change that. She had to find him.

“I see you want to find him?” Obi-wan broke through her thoughts, she looked at him baffled.

“Don’t worry I didn’t look in your mind. I did not have to; it is written all over your face.” He chuckled, Ahsoka only pouted.

“Well, I wanted to do the same thing and I finally got lucky and tracked him down. I had to cash in some favours to get this information, but I have an address where he should reside now, deep down in the lower levels. I wanted to go there today, but I think it would be better for you to do that.”

“What? Why? He needs you too, he needs both of us.”

“Maybe, but I feel that right now he rather needs you by his side, your bond is different than ours, not stronger per sei but differently important. You know him well, even better than I do in some respects, so I think you should be the one. He will open up to you not to me. Not yet. He feels he has betrayed me, which isn’t the case, but I won’t be able to convince or help him like this. So please, go.”

She didn’t know what to say, so she just stared.

“I think that’s the reason why I was still around when you came, and not on my way down. You felt the disturbance over your bond as well didn’t you? I was hoping that you would show up, because I believe you are his only chance now. The only one that could break through.”

He smiled at her throughout his whole monologue, sipping at his tea occasionally, but never breaking eye contact to get his point across. Ahsoka was grateful that he still had this much trust in her, that he would step down in going to Anakin first, because he believed that she would be suited best for meeting him first.

Silence befell them and she broke the intense eye contact, staring at the tabletop, noticing her restless hands, clawing and moving about. She hadn’t noticed till now, but she really was tense, and the concern was eating at her.

“Drink some of the tea,” Obi-wan started “it will ease your nerves.” She just looked at him baffled again, sometimes she forgot how perceptive he was. He had sensed her unrest before she even stepped into his room, picking out a tea that would best calm her. She took a huge gulp and felt some serenity return, her heartbeat levelled out again and her mind cleared.

“Thank you for that.” She said to Obi-wan, he just nodded. “And I will go to Anakin alone, if you think this is the best way to approach this. I don’t have a good feeling about this though.”

“Me neither.”

After that they chatted for another while, catching up on the things that happened to the other during all this time. Ahsoka even told him about all the trouble she got in with the sisters, even if she didn’t want to before, knowing that he would tease her about it. She was right. But she liked it, it had some familiarity some warmth of a bond smithed through time and hardships.

Once they felt that they had talked enough and that the time had come to care for Anakin, they left his apartment and he led her outside, stopping at the top of the steps down the temple. He turned around and looked at her, a concerned expression flashing over his face for a moment. He was good at keeping his emotions at bay, but even the great Obi-wan Kenobi lets a glimpse into his mind slip once in a while.

“Don’t worry Obi-wan.” She said with warmth “It will be okay; we will take care of him.” Now it was time for him to look at her baffled, soon to be replaced with a smile.

“I know. I know it will be, it’s just so… so different than usual, so out of my control and I don’t like that.” He admitted. It was the first time Ahsoka could recall, that he showed some doubt about something or himself. Some uncertainty that ate at him. 

She didn’t think of her action, she just did it. Throwing her arms around him and embracing him in a comforting hug. He tensed at first, but quickly eased into the embrace and returned it. They stayed like that for a moment, recharging on hope. When they broke apart, Ahsoka noticed what she just did and blushed a bit flustered. She never had hugged him before; it was a new sensation but not an unwelcome one. Friends should be able to do that, without the Jedi judging, everyone needs a hug occasionally after all.

“S…sorry.” She said sheepishly.

“Oh, don’t be!” Obi-wan beamed, “It was much needed to be honest, and I quite liked it.” Before she could return something to that, feeling her head burn up, he took something out of his pocket, that immediately took her attention. A little data chip, which he handed to her. 

“That’s his current address. It isn’t a nice neighborhood though, so be prepared to fend off some idiot pulling a stunt on you.” He said a little concern once more shining through. Although it probably was concern for the one on the receiving end, because he knew that she would fold anybody into a little box, that tried anything on her or Anakin while she was down there.

“Thank you for the heads up, I will be gentle.” She smiled, he only chuckled and nodded.

“Call me when you need help, or when you found out anything about what is going on. On this channel I am always reachable” He continued giving her another chip containing a frequency for his personal com link. She took it gratefully and saved it into her own.

They once again shared a nod, before she turned around walking down the steps. The last time she had done so, she had left Anakin and her past behind, walking into an uncertain future, lost and alone. The guilt of leaving Anakin behind once again flared up, but she would make it right now, she wouldn’t leave him. Not again.

Getting to her bike she tapped in the address into her nav computer. Obi-wan didn’t lie, it really was a shitty neighborhood. It was the place least protected by the republican forces, they had no say down there. The whole of the galaxies most unpleasant creatures could be found crawling about there. A perk of such a place though was that nobody asked any questions, probably why Anakin chose this place to begin with.

She got moving driving down into the core, descending further and further away from the light of the top world and more into the neon infested light of the underground. She tried to reach out to Anakin through her connection, but she couldn’t reach him. This didn’t make her feel better at all, but it wasn’t any help to brood over it, she just had to hurry up.

Turning off her bike and taking extra caution to lock it up, not that anybody would really consider lifting her shitty excuse for a bike, but you never knew what an idiot high on spice came to do. It was unusually silent for this time of day and there was nobody outside but her, she didn’t threat it too much, in actuality she found it to be nice, to not be in the middle of a tussling crowd.

Slowly she made her way to the building of her interest. It was a low-priced motel, not nice but it would do for a night or two. She stepped inside and walked up to the receptionist. He was a Quarren who didn’t seem really interested in her, or anything for that matter. He read some magazine on his pad, that she could identify to be some kind of porn. She had gotten used to things like that after leaving the Jedi order, but it still made her scrunch her nose. 

“Room 306?” She just stated waiting for a reply. The man before her took his time prying his eyes away from his filth to push a few buttons into his computer. He looked at something for a moment before looking at her for the first time, mistrust written all over his face.

“Who is asking?” He blurted.

“That’s none of your concern.” She spat with a little added venom, to make her seem more of a threat, that shouldn’t be underestimated. “I just want to meet the man that stays there that’s all. So which way?”

He looked at her unimpressed but pointed her in a direction. “Up the stairs and to the right.”

She nodded and turned around.

“And sweet cheeks?” He made her stop, contemplating if she should beat him or not. 

“What?” she said through gritted teeth not turning around.

“Tell him to keep it down some. It sounded like bloody murder up there the last night.” He said.

She could feel her blood run cold at that.

“Did you check it wasn’t?” She asked looking at him over her shoulder.

“Do you think I’m crazy?! No that is all for you to check sugar.” He laughed before returning to his porn.

*Great* she thought, her mind running at a hundred clicks an hour. She slowly walked to the door, concentrating to feel anything strange or dangerous in the force, or a sign from him. To her relief she could feel his presence, but still the ill feeling didn’t leave her.

She made it to his door and knocked. Only now realizing that she hadn’t thought about what to say, a little panic welling up inside her. She just had to wing it, or as master Yoda would say, ‘the force let guid you, you must’. Same thing she noticed in her time.

After a few moments, she couldn’t feel any movement inside, so she knocked again and again, but no response. She got a little bit annoyed and decided to just let herself in. A little wave with her hand and the help of the force and she was in, stepping inside the door closing behind her.

She stood inside a dark corridor, that as she could make out had three doors. One probably for the bathroom, one for the bedroom and one she assumed to be a kitchen. Those lowly motels all had about the same layout, so she was fairly confident to where which room was, after staying in some herself over the past months.

Walking further inside she could feel a little panic rise up. What if Anakin was showering and didn’t hear her knocking and she was to just barge inside? It was a quick thought, but also one that she brushed away easily as she ventured further inside. Even if, what would she be afraid of?

She couldn’t hear anything, her eyes slowly accustoming to the darkness, letting her see some clothes littered over the ground. He didn’t seem to take cleaning very seriously, but well, she didn't either. The thing that made her a little nervous though, was that she still couldn't really feel his presence. It was more like a slight buzz in the force, that told her he was still alive, but this buzz was so faint, that if she didn’t focus on it, it just faded away. 

She made it to the door, where she could make out the presence behind and took one deep breath before opening up the door and stepping inside.

No amount of breaths could have prepared her for what she saw before her. Anakin Skywalker, the great general and sword prodigy, her master and friend through war and hardship, the chosen one himself was sitting at a little table staring into the void. Ripped and dirty rags of clothes hanging from his body, his hair a filthy mess, eyes burned red with sleep deprivation and restlessness. Before him a multitude of bottles of any kind, some full some empty, some in states between but all filled with something alcoholic probably strong enough to burn a hole into the hull of a Venator-class cruiser. In his hand he had a bottle as well shaking slightly as he couldn’t hold it steadily in this state. His mechanical arm hanging lazily from his side, a hole in the wall behind him, probably the source of the warden’s noise complaint and the reason why his metal hand seemed a bit taken through the wringer.

It was a sight, that immediately made her tear up. She had never seen him like this before. He just seemed broken, unwilling to go on, keeping himself going through drugs and fantasies. He didn’t even flinch at her entering, not even a look at her. He just continued to stare into space, occasionally taking a sip from whatever he was holding in his good hand.

He scrunched his nose with every sip, so at least he hadn’t lost his distaste for stuff like this, she thought. 

It took her a moment to regroup, to force herself away from crying. She couldn’t right now, her friend needed help first, that was more important now. Her voice was still stuck in her throat, faint and weak, but she managed to croak something out.

“A-Anakin?” She whispered and to her relief he reacted and looked at her, this meant he was at least still in this shell of a human.

“Go away.” He just stated with a slight slur in his voice before breaking the brief eye contact again.

Her jar dropped at that; she had been prepared for anything, but this was unexpected. He just brushed her off completely. Did he realize that she was really there?

“What? Anakin it’s me Ahsoka.” She continued her voice more stable now, her shock fading for confusion.

His eyes darted back to her, a little bit of hope flickering in but immediately dying down again.

“No… no you’re not.” He started his eyes watering slightly “She is in a better place than this, as… as she should be. She is living her life free. She couldn’t be here.”

“What do you mean, I…”

“You’re not real! You never are… you… you’re just like the others… illusions coming to torment me, haunt me for my mistakes… Don’t I drink enough, don… don’t I ignore you enough? You just won’t go away, you always return… Why do you think I would want her to see me like this!? No, she is better off without me… as everyone is. So, leave me be. Let me die in peace…”

A thousand things ran through Ahsoka’s mind as she slowly realized everything what he was saying, everything he was hinting at. Seeing Illusions, thinking everyone was better off without him, him wanting to die. She was at a loss of words; the tears now freely fell from her eyes as she looked at this husk of her old friend. 

“What happened to you? What… what did I do to you?” She whispered more to herself than to him, trying to compute all of this.

“You did nothing… you did what was best for you. What you should have done.” He chuckled into himself. “I am glad you did, with… with me there is no future.” He concluded taking another big gulp from his bottle.

This was it, something snapped inside of Ahsoka, the dam finally broken, as the tears obstructed her vision, but she was still able to practically jump over to Anakin and take him into a tight embrace, pressing his face into her chest.

His bottle fell to the ground and broke with a loud cracking noise, spilling its contents all over the floor, but she didn’t care, she just cared for the broken man in her arms, who had become stiff at her actions.

“Sn… snips, you… you’re really here, aren’t you?” He mumbled into her chest before looking up into her eyes, his red and restless ones searching for the truth in hers. She sobbed and cried and could only nod, while pressing him harder into herself.

His eyes widened at the realization of what was happening, and she could see them tear up as well before he looked away again. 

“Oh… Oh no. You shouldn’t see me li… like this.” His voice broke.

“It’s okay… I am here now… everything will be okay.” She cried out between sobs, her body trembling, not holding her weight anymore. Anakin relaxed and folded into himself, resulting in them both sliding to the ground, he on his knees and she before him, still embracing him. 

He finally returned it and started to sob slightly into her neck, while she held onto him, almost even more than he was onto her.

“It’ll be okay.” She repeated with a little bit more conviction than before, as they both held themselves together, to keep from breaking apart.

“Ye…yeah”. Anakin sobbed.

After what seemed like hours and they both had cried themselves dry, they broke apart. Ahsoka leaned against the table rubbing her puffy eyes so she could look at him again.

“You look like shit.” She mumbled sniffling slightly.

He just looked at her, his eyes even redder than before, his mechanical arm throttling lightly next to him. Anakin still looked at her like he was unsure if she was real or not, but he apparently decided to believe it for now.

“What… what are you doing here Snips?” He asked his hoarse voice sounding like sandpaper. “You should not be here.” he said letting his head fall into his good hand, obstructing their eye connection.

“You shouldn’t either!” She spat, getting angry at his dumbness.

He looked up at her smiling slightly.

“Yeah, well…” he pulled himself up onto his chair again grabbing another bottle. “I like it here.” He gestured with it, before taking a sip. "Better than the barracks."

“Bullshit…” Ahsoka fumed while also standing up and taking a chair to sit in front of him. “And stop drinking that gunk.”

“That might not be such a good idea.”

“Why not?”

He just gestured to the hole in the wall behind him. 

“You might think I am bad off like this, but sober… let’s just say, I cannot guarantee for anything anymore when I am sober.”

“But drinking yourself to death is not a solution…”

“Working fine so far.” He chuckled hollowly while taking another sip. Pulling him out of this will be a challenge Ahsoka noticed.

“No but really, why are you here… *How* are you even here to begin with. Nobody knows where I am and I change places almost every two days.”

“Obi-wan.”

“Obi-wan… of course” Anakin sighed taking another sip.

“We worry about you.”

“Nothing to worry about… ‘M fine.” He smiled a toothy and very uncharacteristically smile. Ahsoka just raised her brow looking him up and down. He seemed to have gotten the message.

“Yeah well… at least I am fine here. I do not intend to go back anywhere… I am done with all of this war and jedi shit… I am done with everything.”

“With Padme too?”

“… Obi-wan told you that as well huh… \*sigh\*. Well yeah with her too.”

“But we are not done with you. We want our Anakin back.”

“Ahsoka come on… you know full and well that you are better off without me. You severed all the ties to your old life for a reason after all. You cannot save me… you cannot save the order. Hell, I cannot even save myself, there is nothing left to save. I fulfilled my purpose and now I wait till the force decides that my time has come to die and go over into the living force… or whatever Yoda taught about this mumbo jumbo… Just go, live your life… be happy… just leave me behind.” 

“Not happening! … I left you once, that’s a mistake I will not repeat again.”
