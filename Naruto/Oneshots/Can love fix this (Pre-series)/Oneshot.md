# Can love fix this?

*Plop* with a loud thud the last box was placed on the creaking wooden floor, which looked like it had endured quite a lot in its time. The little holes and cracks which were littered all over its surface, together with its weathered down texture and slight discoloration at spots where probably heavy furniture has had its place in the past, gave the floor a characteristic almost vivid appearance. Even its creaking sounded like the groan of an old man trying to stretch his limbs to only find them hurting and immovable.

“This is the last one Miss. *Cough* You paid already, so we will take our leave now.” a middle-aged man with short and spiky black hair and an overall rather worn down appearance stated matter of factly, with a voice as raspy and deep only one could achieve who smokes an ungodly amount of cigarettes everyday. He followed it up with a long and silent yawn that looked like it would tear his face apart at any given moment, while lazily hanging his hands in his pockets.

The young and petite woman he addressed, almost disappeared in this mess of small and big boxes. If you didn't look closely you could even miss her slender form completely, as she almost cowered behind the boxes, her hands fidgeting in front of her face in an uncertain manner.

She glanced back at him a bit startled, as if not expecting someone to speak with her. Her big lavender eyes pierced into the man in front of her, contemplating what to say. Her mouth only twitched slightly, but no words came out. In the end she just nodded vigorously to signal her approval while seeming utterly lost and misplaced, like a puppy in a meatgrinder.

“Take care Missy.” he mumbled as he turned around and left her behind, no other glance spared in her direction. The other two men standing in the apartment watched their college walk through the door open mouthed and quickly followed suit, not without shooting her an apologetic look and bowing slightly before sprinting out and closing the door, as calmly as possible.

A pressing silence filled the room as soon as she was left alone. The young girl looked around as she tried to fathom this new situation which unfolded itself in front of her. Alone was the only word she could think of at that moment, which described her situation rather perfectly.

Her name was Hinata Hyuuga, daughter of Hiashi Hyuuga head of ‘Hyuuga Digital’ and Entrepreneur in the field of Software Development. She had lived her life under his supervision, being home schooled and forbidden to leave without guard protection and personnel who watched her each and every step and catered to her each and every need, before she even uttered them.

Until the day she persuaded him to let her attend a public school she didn’t even know kids her own age, only her younger sister, who wasn't really the best conversation partner for her. And this too was only allowed under heavy regulations from her father of course.

But starting now, everything will change. No longer will she live within this cage his protection became. Now she finally will be free to to what she wants to do. She had a falling out with him after he had tried to enroll her in a school he deemed the safest and to get her to aspire a job which he approved of, essentially making sure he could control her even after graduation at a place where he had influence.

This had been the last drop for her. She never had given him much contra and she wouldn't have even thought about screaming at him. But this day she screamed. She screamed until her lungs hurt and her voice gave out. Screaming at him all her pent up frustration and pain he had caused. Which had left her father speechless, even remorseful by seeing his usually so calm and collected daughter become this worked up.

In the end Hinata had convinced him to let her go and finally live her own life, the way she wanted it to be and not according to his plans for her. Which was unusual for him to say the least. She felt guilty about the things she had said to him in her rage, after all, he just had tried to keep her safe and to do what in his thinking was best for her. But she was certain that she made the right decision in taking this step. For the both of them. For him to reflect his actions and for her to breath free air again.

Hinata had left her home to live on her own for the first time and attend a new High School in a new City. The City in question being Konoha.

Calling it a new City wasn’t quite right though, considering she had once called this city her home before, when she was not more then a little girl. But after her mothers untimely demise, Konoha was never home again. Her father had taken her and her sister Hanabi and left the city in a hurry the day their mother had been buried. He had left this place behind out of grief and fear for his daughters.

But Hinata was back now wishing to start a new life, one where nobody was afraid of her families name and her fathers power. One where she finally could meet some friends and be seen as the person she really was. One in which she could decide on her own fate and be free of her fathers medlings.

But of course there was more to the decision to return this city. The real reason why she had chosen Konoha to be this new starting point and something she could not tell her father about yet. Something that had haunted her since the day she left this city when she only was 5 years old.

But now was not the time to think about sad things like that. Hinata softly shook her head to rid her mind of all these thoughts and approached the first box in her reach. For now she had to unpack this mess of cartons and make this place feel at least a little bit lively and welcoming. Thinking yourself to death in a cluttered room was not what she returned here for.

'I should open the windows first and let in some fresh air'. She thought to herself as she paused and moved away from the boxes to go to the window which was closest by.

This apartment seemed to her like it hadn’t been used for a while. Hinata just took the first one she could find online, to get out of her fathers mansion as soon as possible and didn’t care that much about what it would look like and how big it would be.

The place she from now on called her home was situated at the outskirts of Konoha, which was in accordance to the one condition her father had set before he allowed her to live on her own. She wasn’t allowed to live near the city center, “I can’t even begin to imagine what could happen to a young and beautiful girl such as yourself at a dire place like this! It is as filthy as the people who live there and the dangers that await you are inexhaustible”.

She didn’t necessarily agree with her fathers reasoning, but neither did she want to live near the city center. She wanted to be within reach of nature and have a quite environment surrounding her. And she also wanted to be near to certain places located in Konoha. Which incidentally lay near the outskirts and her new apartment. Not that her father did know.

Her apartment was inside a multi-storey building which harbored at least 5 more of its kind. Hinata wasn’t proud of this trait of hers, but she was too shy to ask the landlord for the number of people living under the same roof as herself. The only hint she could go of was the number of door bells situated at the entrance to the house, which she had seen as she led the 3 movers to her new residence.

There was one with her name on it, which by the looks of it had been glued onto the bell in a hurry and five others with washed out names she couldn’t decipher as she passed them earlier.

But she could look into that later, for now she had enough other things to do. The lavender eyed girl had been so nervous of this day after all. She had talked to the landlord once and then rented the apartment right away without even looking at it beforehand. Hinata just wanted to be done with it and took the first opportunity that presented itself to her, even if that would be risky.

So today was the first time she stepped inside her new home which hopefully wouldn’t be a dump or a graveyard. It wasn’t even remotely comparable to the mansion she had lived in up until now. Her room alone had been as big as this whole apartment. But she never really liked the vastness ant the extravagance of this style of living anyways.

Directly behind the apartment door was the living room which also served as a connector for the other three rooms. On the left hand side were two doors, one led to a small bathroom and the other to her new bedroom and between them stood two shelf's made of some kind of pale wood. They seemed a little wobbly but they offered enough room to store everything she owned, which wasn't much.

On the right hand side was a big - thankfully intentional - hole in the far side of the wall, which connected the kitchen to the living room. That gave the whole apartment a open and welcoming feeling Hinata really fancied.

The last wall, the one pointing to the house's front contained a large window and a glass door which led to a small balcony. This side faced the city center and probably provided a breathtaking view during the night. Only being aided by the fact that the apartment was located at the second to last floor of the building.

Next to the hole in the wall that led to the kitchen stood a TV on what appeared to be an old table made of dark wood. It looked like it would collapse at any moment if so much as a feather was added to the weight lying upon it.

In the middle of the living room stood a soft dark blue sofa, with room for at least three people, facing said Television. It was set on a large hairy rug which covered the middle of the room with a warm red color.

There also was a wardrobe next to the apartment door on the right and a glass table with 4 wooden chairs that stood half and half in living room and kitchen.

Hinata had agreed to keep the old furniture in this apartment, for she had not much to bring herself and didn't want to buy any. The only furniture she had brought, was her queen sized bed, a nightstand and a wardrobe for her clothes which she had the three movers build in the bedroom.

These three pieces were enough to fill the room almost completely, along with the table and chair that had been in there before. But Hinata didn’t care, she was just glad that her bed fit in. It was the one and only luxury she had allowed herself to bring with her from her mansion live.

After finally seeing the place, she was relieved with the fact that it looked okay and was to her liking. Only the bathroom was to her dissatisfaction. One of the only things she missed about her old mansion was the bathroom with its big tub, warm furry carpet that was laid out all over the floor and the assortment of bath salts that filled the cupboards. This bathroom was small and its bathtub didn’t look like anything anyone would want to lie inside for longer periods of time, if they didn't wish to contract some kind of disease.

But besides that, the somewhat moldy smell and the dust which had laid itself over everything inside the apartment leaving it coated with a thick layer of gray, she was happy to call this place her new home.

After opening all the windows she could find, Hinata stood on the small balcony and took in a deep breath.

'Don’t freak out, you got this! This is not thaaat frightening. You are just living alone in a city you don’t know well, together with people you probably never met before inside an apartment which you have never seen… absolutely no reason to lose it…' Hinata thought to herself while losing it just a little bit. She had taken this step out of her own volition, but that didn’t mean she wasn’t afraid.

She took another deep breath and made her way back inside. 'For now I just have to unpack my things and place them around, then I can decide what to do next.'

With that she finally opened the first box which contained some of her dearest possessions, such as one of the few pictures she had of her mother and herself back when she had been a little kid. Hinata looked intently at this picture. It had been 11 almost 12 years since it was taken, shortly before her mother died and she left Konoha. Hinata had been a 5 year old kid back then and now she was a sixteen year old woman. How time flies... She thought bitterly as she walked into the bedroom to place the picture on top of her nightstand.

She slowly unpacked all the boxes and filled in the shelves and wardrobes with all her belongings, while she ridded the apartment from the layer of dust it was held captive with. It took her a few hours to finally finish her task. The apartment was shining, almost glimmering after she had cleaned it, while all the boxes were emptied and thrown out afterwards.

Hinata was happy with the result, but something still felt off. After she placed down everything she called her own, she realized that even if it seemed much at first her belongings were only scant not being able to fill the place to the slightest.

The rooms were still kind of empty. Especially the walls, because she had no pictures or paintings she could place on them. It all felt kind of lonely and suffocating to her. Being overwhelmed by her feelings Hinata decided to leave her apartment for now and walk around a bit to clear her mind and get used to the area.

'It probably is normal to feel that way, when you move to a new place on your own', she tried to appease herself, but she didn’t like this feeling at all. She didn’t like to be powerless.  

It was a cold and windy day. The last Sunday of march and the last day before the start of the new school year. Clouds quickly passed over her head occasionally blocking the sunlight drowning her surroundings in a faint shadow.

The wind blew strongly through the streets which where not cluttered with houses and buildings in this part of town and thus offered no protection. Hinata regretted not bringing a jacket, being hit by the wind which blew under her skirt and lose shirt making her shiver ever so slightly.

It was already the afternoon when she left her apartment and the sun was starting to make its descend, dimming and making room for her successor. The almost golden light interacting with the moving shadows, gave all it touched an almost dreamlike flair. Hinata marveled at everything she saw, quickly forgetting all the bad thoughts and feelings that had plagued her mind only mere moments ago.

The City around her was beautiful. The skyscrapers hadn’t made their way to the outskirts yet, leaving this part of town rather open. Surrounding Hinata were many normal detached houses with an occasional block of  multi-storey buildings, giving it the suburb feeling she had expected it to still have. This hadn't changed from years before. All of the residences were woven into a network of trees, while nature surfaced everywhere it could. Perfectly mowed lawns side by side with wild and overgrown gardens that seemed to be taken straight out off a fairy tale.

It was quiet and there were not many cars driving on the roads or people outside either. Only a few walked around like Hinata or sat in their gardens. Everything just had this dozy charm to it much to Hinatas liking. While looking around and enjoying her surroundings, Hinata allowed her feet to just carry her wherever they wanted her to go. Not caring for where she actually was headed.

The next thing her attention was drawn to, made her stop dead in her tracks. Her brilliant eyes widened in shock as she saw something on the other side of the road. Unable to move she stared at the sign marking the entrance to a secluded and small park, which for other bystanders would just seem like any other ordinary park and not even solicit a reaction.

'Could it be?' she thought to herself as she once again found the ability to use her legs. Slowly she crossed the street never letting the sign leave her sight. As she stood before the entrance she slowly peeked insight, hiding her intentions like the act alone was something considered illegal or reprehensible to do.

'No doubt... this is THE place' she commented in her head. Feeling her body tense at the thought and an uncontrollable fear rise up from a place deep within her heart. But for now her brain was still in charge of her body and decisions, contemplating if she should enter or if she should run away screaming, like her gut was suggesting.

'How did I end up here? I wanted to visit this place sometime, but... I didn’t plan for it to be today. My feet just led me here without me even noticing… I don’t know if I’m ready for this… if I ever will be ready…' Her mind kept on racing, while she tried to keep the upper hand over her emotions.

'No! I will not run again! I have ran my entire life and now fate or whatever, has led me here. This has to be a sign, there has to be a reason I am right here right now… I can do this!… I think…' With her mind more or less made up she managed to move her body and reluctantly stepped inside the park.

For anyone else this would be a place of dreamlike beauty. A small path winded itself through a plethora of plants, trees and undergrowth. On the right side a little stream meandered itself, gently following the paths shape. The stream made a soothing sound which only got amplified by the happily chirping birds and the wind which rustled through the treetops. But Hinata didn’t see or hear any of this. Her mind was locked in her past as memories rushed past her inner eye. She remembered many occasions she had been here in this very park walking this very path together with her mom.

Everything looked the same: the narrow path, the trees hanging their branches over her head to protect her from the direct sunlight, the leafs shadows dancing on the ground while the wind gently blew through them. Even the smell was the same, wet dirt paired with the faint scent of resin.

Her mind got more and more agitated as she stepped closer to the spot where all this fear and all this grief had their beginning. The trees parted on either side of the way as she arrived at a clearing at the end of the park. Surrounding her now was a field of grass which again was bordered by a thin outline of trees. There were numerous perfect spots to picnic or to just sit under the shadow of a tree, but today nobody did. Just like it had been on this acursed day all those years ago.

The second entrance could be seen from the position Hinata was standing at, but her attention was solely on the thing that stood half way between it and her. An old wooden bench. It looked just like any other wooden bench you would expect to stand inside a park like this. Probably being there much longer than she or even her father had lived. But for Hinata seeing it was like looking down the maw of hell itself.

Her body began to shake and her mind was a mess, but she was determined. One foot after the other she inched herself closer to the bench, fighting the urge to just turn around and run away as fast and far as her feet could possibly carry her. Pictures rose inside her head flashing before her eyes, blurring memory and reality together to an indistinguishable mush There was only mere feet of a distance between her and the bench when she no longer was able to move, her mind engulfed in the memory she had so desperately tried to suppress all this years.

Blood. Blood everywhere. On the bench, on the path, dripping from the blades of grass and bushes and sticking to her. She could almost see it again as she was staring at the ground, at the spot where her mother had died right in front of her. By now she was full on shaking, slowly looking down at her hands seeing blood drip off of them as a familiar metallic smell started to creep up her nose. She felt nauseous and dizzy, unable to move or to stop the pictures ravaging her mind. She wanted to scream and to run, but she couldn’t get out of this unending loop happening in front of her eyes.
 
Her mother getting stabbed, her crying for help out of complete and absolute helplessness, the disability to do anything about it. “Nobody came… Nobody.” she muttered to herself when the presence of someone finally managed to pull her back to reality. Her heart beating in her head, knees weak. Hinata felt like she just has been put through the wringer. Her body was still shaking lightly and she wasn’t able to manifest even a single clear thought. But there was no time for her to recover. The presence she had felt belonged not to one, but to three men, who now stood around her, a little bit too close for her liking.

Two of them stood on either side behind her and the third made his way around to face her directly, flashing her an obnoxious smile which would surely burn itself inside of Hinatas nastiest nightmares. She could feel their gazes scan her body from head to toe and the primeval desire behind them. A slight shiver made its way down her spine followed by a feeling of danger. She had to get out of there and that fast. But the three men had already cornered her to prevent that from happening. She was trapped.

They seemed to be a little older than her, maybe around 20 or 21 and a strong scent of liquor was glued to their each and every move. From the looks of it, they didn’t seem to have trained bodies, but Hinata could already see, that if she had to she couldn’t overpower either of them by pure strength. Only with technique, but it had been some time since she had been trained to defend herself.

“Look who we have ‘ere. Ya sure are a beauty aren’t ya. Too beautiful to be aaaall alone inside a park at an hour like this.” The man in front of her blurted out intensifying the burning smell of alcohol while the other two just chuckled and stepped even closer to her. “We luckily have the time, so we’ll look after ya, we wouldn’t want something bad to happen to a fragile girl like yaself, would we?”

Hinata knew she was in a pretty dangerous situation and her mind still couldn’t focus enough to think her way out of this. She tried to waste some time, until someone else would enter the clearing or until she could find an opening to escape.

“N-No I am f-fine, th-thank you. I was j-just about to h-head home.” She stuttered while forcing her feet to move forward to try and get past the men surrounding her. But it obviously wouldn’t be that easy.

The man stepped in front of her again, forcing her to stop. “Oh that really is no problem at all dear. I promise ya the four of us will have sooo much fun together. Don’t you want to have some fun too?” He stated with a stern expression failing to cover up the lust inside his eyes and the intention behind his words.

“N-No.” Hinata tried to answer but it was too late. The two men behind her, had gripped her arms and held them behind her back, while the other pressed his right hand over her mouth. She frantically tried to scream and rip free, but her voice was muffled by the large hand which covered almost half of her face and her body still not ready to fight. Warm tears ran down her cheeks but that only made the man’s smile even wider.

“Scream as much as you want. Nobody will hear ya. We will be finished with you and long gone before anyone even finds you.” exclaimed the man pressing her mouth shut, like this situation was nothing new to him. His eyes again wandered over Hinatas body taking in all her features as they went by. She still tried to get free of the hands holding her firm at place, but as expected she wasn’t strong enough to break free from this hold. Especially not after reliving her past so graphically just moments ago.

Her movement stopped abruptly though when she felt the other hand of the man in front of her caress her stomach, slowly making its way up her waist aiming for her breasts. All her energy plummeted at once to a total of zero as she lost the hope to make it out of this unharmed. She closed her eyes trying to zone out, as she heard a voice unfamiliar to her.

“Hey, You three knuckleheads! Would you be so ‘kind’ to release her now? Don’t you see that she doesn’t like the idea of having ‘fun’, with three miserable drunken losers as yourselves? Leave now, otherwise I will have no other choice but to hurt you in ways you never wanted to experience, believe me.” the voice said in a kind of bored and monotone fashion.

The three man stiffened and slowly faced the origin of the voice taunting them, which had spoken out of nowhere. Hinata who also was surprised by the sudden intruder, tried to look at him as well, but the grip she was in prevented her from turning her head. She could only make out a silhouette of a young man with tousled blond hair, by moving her eyes.

He stood right behind them next to the bench. He must have come the same way she did and while the three men were occupied with her and she with them, they didn’t notice someone else joining the group. It took a moment for the three attackers to really understand what he had said, but after their shock had subsided the one in front of Hinata responded to this provocation by stepping away from her and approaching the blond.

She now was able to turn her head and really look at this young man. He had massively tousled, almost spiky blond hair which slightly moved with the small breeze blowing past him. His facial features told her that he couldn’t be much older than she herself. But the look on his face was quite emotionless and blank as he eyed the one who approached him. Hinata’s eyes wandered down further on this odd boy who had stepped up to help her, taking in his whole appearance. He wore a black leather jacket on top a black Hoodie and a worn down jeans with holes in it, which didn’t look like it had holes because of a fashion trend.

Her attacker reached him and directly grabbed onto the boys collar, which the man used to pull the blond closer to his face as he started to scream at him. “What did you just say you little shit!? Who do ya think ya are to boss US around? You better roll up your balls back into your pants and leave before YOU get hurt!”

The boy didn’t even flinch at the actions of this man screaming directly in his face. He only let out a sigh when the one in front of him had finished his tantrum. As he closed his eyes he took his hands out off the leather jacket's pockets where they had resided until now, while the attacker holding him was kind of spellbound by this reaction.

The next thing happened fast. The blond boy kicked his heel onto the foot of the attacker, which led him to scream out in agony. The pain loosened his grip around the boys collar, which the latter utilized by grabbing the man’s now slacking arms from underneath and pressing them up with a swift but powerful push. Now free from this hold he switched to the offensive with punching the man straight in the face. Blood spewed out of the olders nose as he collapsed on the ground holding his face screaming. All of this had happened in less than two second and looked like movements the boy was routinized in.

“I said you three losers should get lost! You don’t want me to really lose my temper.” said the boy after fixing his collar and wiping his face clean of the spit he was hit with from the others screaming.

He still sounded bored but Hinata could hear a glimpse of anger welling up in his voice as he said it. The other two still were restraining her as they stared dumbstruck at the boy that had just bested their friend. After finding the ability to think again, they both released the girl and started to charge straight at the blond. Hinata looked on in pure aw as the two tried to attack him, but he just dodged their attacks, occasionally landing a punch while making them lose their footing.

After half a minute he had enough of this game as it seemed and started to really fight them. Some hard punches later and all three men were lying on the ground wincing in pain.

“I say it one last time. Be GONE!” shouted the boy with a might in his voice that managed to even pull Hinata back to reality, who to this point still had been trapped inside her thoughts.

Only then did she fully grasp the situation she had been in, before the boy had shown up to save her. The shock and blocked out feelings hit her like a train, making her knees buckle as she sank to the ground breathing heavily and shaking uncontrollably. The three men looked up with fear at the boy who had just beaten them to pulps without even breaking a sweat. They for sure were not the brightest bunch to ever roam the surface of this planet but even they knew, that they should just run for their lives at this point.

Holding their bleeding faces they ran for it as fast as they possibly could, almost tripping over their own feet multiple times. Hinata didn’t notice any of this though. She was a shaking mess on the floor. After seeing her mother die again and almost being brutalized she felt completely limp and her mind was still racing like an out of control roller coaster which only got faster by the minute.

“Are you alright?” asked a kind voice besides her ear, pulling her out of the chaos of her mind again. She looked up only to be met with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen. They were as brilliantly blue as the sky itself and as deep as the deepest ocean. She could see a kindness in them only reserved for her to see, pared with a deep terrible pain. At first sight they almost seemed dull, but all the emotions hidden within became clear once she looked past the pain and dove into the depths behind the surface.

His slight smile shone like the brightest torch in the darkest cave, illuminating the dark and lonely feelings she had filled her heart with. His imperceptibly waving golden locks reminded her of the sun itself, gleaming around his face as if he was an angel sent by the heavens. Hinata immediately forgot where she was and lost herself inside his glimmering eyes, almost forgetting to breathe.

Who is he?
