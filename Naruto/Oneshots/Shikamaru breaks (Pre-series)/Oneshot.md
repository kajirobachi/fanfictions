# Shikamaru breaks

*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*

*When is it that we realize the real worth of something? We may appreciate it or depend on it, but we’ll only really understand its importance once it is lost, wouldn’t you agree? It’s an interesting question to ponder, even more so as we all seem to know the answer intently. We inevitably will lose many things in our lives and experience this phenomenon firsthand and every time we will regret not to have cherished it more. Only to do so over and over again, never to stop and learn from our mistakes.*

*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*

*How has it come to this?*

Shikamaru stumbled slightly, almost falling over something cold and rigid sticking out of the ground as he made his way through the darkness. His eyes couldn’t even register his hands waving before them as he tried to guard himself of anything obscuring his way out of the pitch-black hell, he had maneuvered himself into.

The crunch of gravel and dirt, and the high pitched \*pat\* of an occasional path stone beneath his feet the only indicators that he wasn’t lost in the middle of the forest yet, but on his way to a place where he could see and think again.

A Nara should be able to navigate through the dark like it was the easiest thing in the world, instilled in their very being as the darkness was an inseparable part of them. His Shinobi training should guide him, should make him long for this darkness, but instead it slowly filled his lungs like viscous oil, making him gasp for air with every unbearable step.

*How has it come to this?*

This same question cut through every cohesive thought trying to fight its way to the forefront of his brain, burning away every possibility of a strategy to form. Everything crumbled within him, his vision blurred, distorting the little white flickers of light in the distance he barely recognized.

He was lost. In more ways than one, he was stranded in this never-ending darkness which now seemed to ooze out of himself, out of every pore, encasing him in a black layer of despair. Drowning him within it, gnawing at his very soul.

*How has it come to this?*

He didn’t know, he knew nothing anymore, his feet just dragged him somewhere he didn’t recognize, almost giving out from under him with every step he took. The noise in his head gained in intensity, the white burning pain in his eyes peeked, the obscurity pulled and clawed at his heart, trying to rip it to shreds. His shallow breaths rang in his ears like someone scratching their nails over a black board.

*Is this what dying feels like?*

A fleeting thought remarked as he was ready to embrace it, feeling his heart moments away from bursting and giving out with a final powerful pump.

\*PUMP\*\*PUMP\*\*THUD\*. His head was hit around from multiple sides, as he fell through space awaiting his demise and the long due end of his suffering. But it never came, the darkness still encapsulating his very being.

Until… He opened his eyes. He didn’t even remember the moment he pressed them shut or felt the strain in his muscles.

But now, finally, everything calmed down as his vision was met with something other than the heavy nothingness of black. The stars brightened the night and eased the turmoil in his mind, causing all the different voices that screamed and whispered at the same time to come to an abrupt halt as he - once again - was able to form a real and lasting thought.

*Where am I? Why am I here?*

He raised his still throbbing head looking around seeing a few trees standing over shallow grass which gradually was replaced by reddish stone as his eyes progressed down the line. Only now did he notice that he was lying on the ground.

Slowly he rose, a spike of pain once again shooting through his head. His hand snapped to his forehead, feeling the beginning of a bruise right in the middle. Glancing around, he soon found the culprit. A low hanging branch, perfectly placed at head hitting height. In his dace, he probably clipped it as he ran out from within the tree line.

*Stupid*

Shikamaru shook his head. Looking around again he noticed how familiar this place seemed, he just couldn’t quite put his finger on it yet how he knew it. He began to walk away from the trees and bushes on unsteady feet, stepping foot on this reddish stone and soon was met with the answer of his whereabouts.

The Hokage mountain. Shikamaru was staring down at Konoha, lit by the uncounted streetlights and the new neon signs that seemed to be so popular these days.

*Good thing this branch stopped me… If it hadn’t, well… let’s call it a nice new paint job for the Streets of Konoha.*

He thought, as he rubbed the pain away from his brow. But why was he here? Or better how had he gotten there?

The last thing he clearly remembered was him waking up and searching for…

“Oh…”

he huffed, before he hunched and sat down a few feet away from one of the Hokage heads. Letting himself fall back to stare up at the stars once again, familiar dread washing over him.

“That’s right.”

he breathed, white clouds of air puffing out from within his mouth, as the memories streamed back, playing before his inner eye. The way he had run out of his home, never stopping until he was completely encased in darkness. All because of…

Closing his eyes, he forced away the memories, feeling his ability to think, slowly but surely pull away from his grip again.

*How has it come to this?*

This same old question once again cut him off, and even now, he had no Idea how to answer it. His eyes opened slowly, taking in this so unusually prominent star strewn sky, counting the orbs to have his mind occupied.

Oh, how he wished he could ascend and become one of those slowly pulsing dots in the distance. One in a trillion, just another insignificant part in the greater scheme of things. Not disturbing himself with the measly little problems steering the lives of each and every being in this world.

Live was a funny thing sometimes. A few hours prior he had returned from his work, tired and blown out, but lately he finally felt like his actions were making a difference in this war-torn world.

He had been happy and content with his life, but now he couldn’t care less. His strive had deflated, he was confused, lost even and every granny of happiness that had been there before, now had succumbed to this staggering emptiness that filled him whole.

This barren wasteland that now was at home at his heart, forbid the thought that there at one point had been anything else. There was no logical explanation, no reason he could try to get behind, nothing that made any sense, and it was killing him.

His intellect and ability to think his way out of any situation no matter how impossible, seemed insignificant in the shadow of this mess he somehow had ended up in. So, what should he do?

“Ahh…”

An annoyed sigh made its way out of his mouth as he massaged his strained temples. His condensed breath ascending to the sky reminded him of how cold the nights in Ni No Kuni had become.

*If I don’t stand up soon, I will freeze to death for sure*,

he reasoned with himself as he desperately tried to feel the cold that was crawling beneath his skin, slowly eradicating his warmth. But there just wasn’t anything he could bring himself to feel anymore, not even the cold. It was just too bothersome.

Where would he even go once, he moved? He couldn’t go home, and he was not in the mood to explain this to any of his friends, so they’d maybe let him crash on their couch for the night. He wasn’t even sure if he really understood what was going on himself. Lying here seemed to be his best option.

*Maybe it would be for the best, if I’d just…*.

His brain concluded, only for him to discard the sentiment in an instant. What the hell was he thinking?

“Do I want to die…?”

he muttered to himself the thought heavy on his conscious as he waited in vain for something in his body to deny it.

“Shikamaru?”

A quiet but familiar voice spoke behind him, which thankfully pulled him out of his now spiraling mind.

Sitting up a bit and turning his head he was meet with an all too familiar sight. Blond hair almost glowing in the night, albeit shorter, they still were unruly and untamed, much so as the person they belonged to. The same carefully knitted red scarf loosely hung around his neck, seeming more vibrant on the black jacket spilling down his toned form. Only his face looked somewhat off. Normally a wide smile would be plastered over it, so contagious nobody could evade its effect to brighten even the worst of moods. Now only a small frown could be seen, with something akin to worry in his blue eyes.

“Naruto?”

He huffed, trying to compute this new information of his friend showing up at this place, in the middle of the night.

What was he doing here? And what was with his face? It just didn’t look right, much like a deer with frog legs wouldn’t seem right when seen walking through the Nara Forest. Had he heard what he just said? Even so, he couldn’t concentrate enough to start up a conversation, as he felt his vision swim slightly again.

Without another word his head fell back to the ground as he resumed his star gazing, leaving Naruto to wonder what was going on.

What Naruto saw wasn’t normal, in fact it was anything but, terrifying if he had to put a word to it. Shikamaru uncannily had his hair down, letting them spill loosely around his face. For the first moment Narutos heart had missed a beat, he could have sworn Neji was lying on the ground before him. But this face was far too familiar to be mistaken at a second glance. He wore the same look the blond had seen so many times. The look of an overthinker. To some it might seem like he was bored, but Naruto knew that there was an impossible fight happening behind those black eyes.

These eyes were what frightened him most though. Normally they had a determined look, a fierce fire burning in their depths, showing his resolve that kept him walking towards his goals no matter what. Now this fire was gone replaced by an unsettling emptiness, that threatened to consume the little light the night could provide, sucking everything in like a black hole.

But that wasn’t what had brought him to stop in his tracks and talk to his ruffed up looking friend.

“Shikamaru it is freezing out here, are you trying to get yourself killed?”

He asked his usually bubbly and happy voice strained and raspy with concern.

Shikamaru’s attention once more shifted over to the blond searching in his eyes for an answer to this very peculiar question, he couldn’t make any sense of. They stared at one another for an endless moment before Shikamaru followed the blue eyes flickering back and forth between his body and his face.

He still wore the same clothes he had woken up in with, white shirt and black sweatpants. Only now he noticed the lack of a jacket or even shoes too. He just had gone outside without bothering to throw some more layers over himself.

He felt his rigid toes now and made out some tried blood on the edge of his sole. What was he thinking to go out like this? Had he been thinking at all? He, Shikamaru who normally didn’t do one thing without thinking it to death?

*Reckless*

was the only thing his mind came up with as he shrugged and without another word ignored the others presence again.

Naruto was at a loss of words. Did Shikamaru even notice him? Really understand that he was there with him and that he himself was turning a slightly darker shade of blue every second?

Shikamaru heard the stomping of boots against the ground and the shuffling of clothes as he felt Naruto sit down beside him. Probably mimicking him and looking up at the sky. No words were spoken, only their breaths could be heard and the occasional *shoo* of some owl hunting for a midnight snack.

He strangely found some solace in this. Feeling himself getting more and more at ease, as sucking in his friend’s presence was calming his mind. He almost forgot that Naruto was there all together, until his voice once more cut through the chilly nights air.

“What happened?”

Turning his head to the side he could see the thoughtful face Naruto mustered, illuminated by the moon, face shining in a silver hew. His eyes not leaving the sky, his breathing level and calm.

“What do you mean?”

He could feel himself answer before he had decided to open his mouth, just going with the flow.

“I mean, why are you lying out here in the middle of the night, freezing yourself to death? You have to have a reason… You always do.”

An unfazed Naruto continued, squinting his eyes slightly at the end.

“Oh, I… I just needed to get some air I guess.” He began, once again trying to figure it out himself as he spoke. “I couldn’t stand being in my apartment anymore.”

“Why?”

“Because no one’s there. Now that Temari has left, it’s just so… empty.”

He concluded as the answer so apparent and so clear in his mind just now registered to be true.

Narutos head snapped away from the sky, his pricing eyes boring into Shikamaru’s side. They were opening wider and wider, until they almost resembled Lee’s.

“She left?”

He mumbled, obviously unsure of what to say, too confused and worried to make sense of it just yet.

“Yeah… I guess. I went straight to bed after work today. This bothersome woman was still there then though. But when I woke in the middle of the night, she wasn’t. I couldn’t find her… I only found a note on the counter, telling me that she is on her way back to Suna.”

While talking Shikamaru instinctively fiddled with his pocket, trying to get a hold of his pack of zigs he always carried. Much to his disappointment, he wasn’t addicted enough to have put them in his sleeping gown or wake enough to take them with him when running out in a frenzy.

There was something inside, but if it wasn’t smoke-able, he didn’t care.

*Troublesome*

“Will she come back?”

“I don’t think so…. She was pretty clear with that actually. *I am sorry Shikamaru, but we’re over. I will be on my way back to Suna already once you read this, so don’t bother following me.*”

He resided the message he had read countless times, taking in every little detail. The crumble of the hastily placed paper, the minimal words, the smudged ink. He committed it all to memory, and still understood nothing.

“Fuck…”

Naruto cursed, casting his gaze down at his feet, lump stuck in his throat.

“I… I just don’t get it man.” Shikamaru started, after a moment of silence between them. “There was no indication, that she was unhappy. Nothing. I would have noticed, wouldn’t I? I mean if not me who else…? Was I too blind to see her hurting? Was I too occupied with myself and the union?”

He could feel himself get more worked up with every word, as his hands now were buried in his hair, pulling at its strands, as to rip the answer out from within his skull.

“If there was a problem, why didn’t she say so? We could have tried to fix it… why didn’t you talk to me? Why leave this note? You’re sorry?! What does that even mean? Don’t be sorry, be frank… don’t just fricking leave, before telling me what’s wrong… Don’t leave me behind like that… don’t leave…”

He whispered before his voice gave out, failing him again, as a new wave of pain and despair washed over him.

He sat up so fast he made his head spin, ready to run once more, as he felt the darkness spiraling in again. But it stopped. A warm pair of arms were swung around him, pulling him into a much-needed embrace, shielding him from the dark.

Naruto squeezed him tightly in his arms, as he finally felt how cold he really was, how much his body had begun to quiver from the freezing temperatures. Normally Shikamaru would have pulled away immediately, but not now. His exhaustion was too overwhelming, and he really needed this.

Shikamaru didn’t know if Naruto could understand his pain, but he more than well understood what he had to do in this moment, and that was more than enough. No words were spoken, as no words were needed anymore.

Shikamaru could feel the fatigue slowly take over, as he finally was able to completely calm down. His destructive thoughts melted away, feeling save in the other’s arms, although he never would admit as much.

His eyes grew heavy and closed, his limbs fell limp the only thing still registering in his mind the slow circles the blond was rubbing into his back. A single tear escaped his eye before he lost consciousness. Temari the last thing he saw, looking disgusted of him before she faded away.

*How has it come to this?*
