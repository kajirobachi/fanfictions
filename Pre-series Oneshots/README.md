# Pre-series Oneshots

Welcome to the **Pre-Series Oneshots** section! 

This is where you’ll find the beginnings of potential full-length stories. Each oneshot here is a standalone chapter that introduces a unique concept or story idea. However, these oneshots aren't just here for reading — they’re also part of a special voting process where **you** get to decide which story gets expanded into a full series!

## How It Works:
- **Read the Oneshots**: Explore the different pre-series oneshots below, each belonging to a different universe or fandom.
- **Vote for Your Favorite**: After reading, you can participate in the poll by following the voting links provided with each story.
- **The Result**: The oneshot with the most votes will be developed into a multi-chapter series, so your vote truly shapes the future of these stories!
