# Guides
In this section, I'll take a moment to explain how GitHub works. This is just a quick overview of what you need to know to work with my fan fiction as I have intended. Please don't think I am trying to make you feel stupid. I just want to be inclusive and cover all bases, so I'll explain things in detail. If you understand faster than others, please just continue on to the sections which interest you or you want to learn from. Thanks!

## Site Traversal
Firstly, it's important to know how to use this site and be able to find and read the fan fiction you want.

### Traversal by directory structure
![Picture of this repositories Front Page showing two red squares the first encasing the readme space and the second the folder contents](/Guides/GFX/Frontpage.PNG)

You can see the front page of this repository above. I've added two red squares to help you understand certain sections. The first square, which is at the bottom, has text in it, just like the text you're reading now. By the time you got here, you'd already got to know this site space, which is where all the text will go. It could be a guide like this, or it could be a piece of fan fiction. 

The second square at the top shows you all the folders and files in this repository. At least, that's how it looks at the top level. It works just like the file system on your computer or smartphone. To access a folder, simply click on it to open and view its contents. As the contents of this repository are likely to change over time, there might be more folders on the front page than in the picture above. Don't worry if this is the case. Same old, same old. For this demonstration I will click on the "Naruto" folder at the top if you want to follow allong. Take a look at the next screenshot to see what it looks like.

![Picture of the Naruto subfolder with two red squares, one which encases the directory structure on the left and the second which encases the directory structure in the top center](/Guides/GFX/NarutoSubFolder.PNG)

This is what you'll see when you click on one of the folders on the front page. In this case, it's the "Naruto" folder. The overlay and site structure have changed a bit, but you'll find everything you need is still in the centre of the site. The new section on the left is marked with a red square numbered 1. This shows the directory structure of the whole repository, with the top-level "Naruto" folder now open. In this example, other subfolders of the "Naruto" folder are also visible, but this may not be the case for you if you follow along with this guide. I've already extended those other folders for this screenshot, so I can explain something in a moment.

The second square shows another view of the directory structure. In this example, it shows the contents of the "Naruto" folder. On the front page, this section showed the top-level contents of the repository. Now it has moved to show the contents of the folder we just clicked and selected. You can use either of these views to navigate the repository. You'll see the same section below this second square, which shows some text. This text will open automatically.

From the overview on the left, you can click on any of the folders or files in the first square to open them and see what's inside. As you might notice on the left side of each folder, there is a little arrow or triangular form, which misses one side of the triangle. You can use this to extend and close folders in this section. This is what I did, open up more of the folders as an example for you. I could then click on the "Oneshot.md" file to open the Oneshot.

In the content view in the second square, you can click on the folders or files as you did on the front page. The folder which has the name ".." represent the back button. Just press this and you'll move up one folder level. In this case, you'll go back to the top layer, which was shown on the front page. With deeper subfolder structures, you just go up to the folder that encases this one.

### Traversal by embedded links
![Picture of the main README File on the Frontpage scrolled down to the end of the text](/Guides/GFX/MainReadmeBotton.PNG)

In the screenshot above, you'll see the text that's displayed on the front page. Once you've scrolled down to the bottom (this might look different at a later point, but the info here still applies), you'll see the following: In the red square, you'll see three bullet points. You'll notice that each of these texts is blue and underlined. This are links. If you click on the text, you'll be taken to another site within this repository. As we saw in the previous chapter, you can use the folder structures to navigate the repository, but you can also use those links to do so. If you click on the second bullet point in the red square, you'll end up on the same page as if you clicked on the "Naruto" folder at the top. It'll show you the same view as in the second screenshot from the last chapter.

You'll see these blue and underlined texts on all text views, which you can use to navigate the document. The links are always named for what they will leed to. You'll usually find a back button at the bottom of each page. In this case, there's a link you can see in the screenshot that will just take you back to the top of the page, as it's the front page and there's nothing to go back to. Sometimes, the "back" link will take you to an overview page that's one layer up. This might not be where you started from, as there are a few different ways to get to some of the pages.

## Naming conventions
The way I name files and folders is designed to be clear and to the point. I'll still run through them for you.

![Picture of the Naruto subfolder with two red squares, one which encases the directory structure on the left and the second which encases the directory structure in the top center](/Guides/GFX/NarutoSubFolder.PNG)

I'm going to reuse one of the screenshots from the [Traversal by directory structure](#traversal-by-directory-structure) chapter, which shows different folders and files in the red square numbered one. The folders at the top will be named after the fandom they contain stories from. There might be other folders that aren't relevant to this, like the "Guides" folder. But the ones that are directly related to fanfiction will probably be the most interesting for you anyway. You'll also find folders labelled "Oneshots" or "Series," which differentiate between types of stories. In the screenshot at position one, the Naruto folder only had a "Oneshots" folder at that time. No matter what story differentiation you choose, the folders that directly correspond to the stories they hold will have the same name.

In the story folders, like the "Can love fix this" folder in the screenshot at position 1, you'll see two files. One is called "README" and the other is called "Oneshot". The "Oneshot" file is the story or one-shot in this case. If you select it, you'll be able to read the story. In longer stories, you might find files with names like "Chapter 1" and so on. You'll find a 'README' file in almost any folder. This is just the way GitHub does things. When you open a folder, it'll look for a "README" file and, if it finds one, it'll automatically show you what's in it in the text area. Personally I would use a different naming convention for my use case here, but i think it is understandable enough. As these files are automatically opened, they include details about the context they are in. The "README" file on the front page contains the general information about the repository. One in a fandom folder contains information about the fandom and another inside a story folder contains information like summaries and tags as well as warnings of the story.

## Why GitHub?
Why would anyone want to use GitHub for their writing in the first place? Before I can answer that question I should quickly define what GitHub is used for and what benefits it provides for anyone who writes stories of any kind and how that can benefit the readers and who they could contribute to the stories directly, if the author so choses.

### What is GitHub
GitHub is a service used primarily by software developers and people who have anything to do with creating or promoting software. Underlying the service is a tool named git. Git has some different uses but let me explain. Say you want to write a story. You begin writing and have a file named "MyStory". You write for a few hours, before you quit for the day. The next day you come back and reread what you have written but find some errors and a section you do not fancy anymore so you delete and replace it with something else, as well as adding more to the story. The next day you do the same, but notice that what you have deleted the day before would have fit better with what you now want the story to be. But damn it... you deleted that yesterday and hit save for the file, no way to get it back, so you have to write it again and approximate it as best as you can, but what you end up with is not as good as what you had before. You make a copy of the file, one containing the changes you made yesterday and the other your rewrite from this day. You keep writing with the second file and keep the other just in case. similar things happen and now you have 10 different files, with different versions of the story - some with small differences, some with big - and one master file, in which you keep the current status as you want it. A bit exagerated maybe, but if you have ever written something creative, the chances are high, that you know what I am talking about.

Now you have this tool named git, which helps with exactly those two problems. Versioning and change management. Let's redo the example one more time, but this time we use git as a tool to help us. As before you begin writing a story and have one file containing it. Once you are finished for the day you open your git tool and add this file to your new repository for this story, which will hold any files you need for it. This is the innital state of your story and you "commit" it meaning you save the file to this repository as well as its state. The next day you add more to the story and fix a few more errors. Which you then commit again. The file is already part of the repository so you just commit the new state. After you realize that a part you wrote yesterday isn't something you like, so you delete and rewrite it. Once again commiting this change. The next day you want it back. What now? You have the file in the repository. After you deleted the part you saved, as before, and can't get the old version back from it, as before. But you remember, that you have used the git tool as well. Going into it, you see that you have three commits. The initial one, the one for the changes on the second day and the one where you deleted that part you want back now. With the tool you can just revert that deletion and the file is back in the state from right after the second commit and you can continue working with the part you wanted back in the file again. As you keep writing you are not sure which parts to use at some points, with major differences to the story. For this you can use the tool to save different states simultaniously, saving these versions which you later can pick from or put together as you want. With this, you just have one file and all changes from the very beginning available to you, so you can revert to any which you want and see what you added and changed at what point in time.

GitHub itself is just an extention to the git tool, which you would use locally on your computer. GitHub allows to save that repository on the internet, so you can pull it to different computers if you want to work on multiple machines, which all share the same information. Also you can make the repository public so other people can see your writing or code in the traditional sense and use it as they want, by the definitions of usage you have set. Other people can also colaborate on the files if you want. Allowing for different people to work on the same file, without the need to copy it, so that versions don't get overwritten and things get deleted, that shouldn't be. There are other sites that offer the same services, but GitHub is dare I say the most well known in the software space, so I use it as well. There are also many other things it can be used for, but those would not be beneficial to describe here right now.

### Benefits of GitHub in writing
This is basically the Tl;dr version of the chapter directly before this, as it describes what GitHub can be used for. So for more information read that chapter, if you have skipped it. The key benefits for using GitHub for writing are the following:

- Change management (each change since inception of the story can be revisited and reverted to if need be)
- Version management (you can keep many different version of the story at the same time, with only one file and change between them)
- Contributions (Other people or the readers can directly interact with the content and help form it -> more on that in the next chapter)

## Contribution of readers
For how GitHub is beneficial please read the chapter [Why GitHub?](#why-github). Everything which is discussed here, requires you to have a GitHub account. If you do not want to create one, that is totally fine, but please understand, that in this case you cannot participate in contributing to works.

### What does Contribution mean?
With contribution I prupose the possibility for you to work on my stories with me. As just a normal user you can open up every story I have written and change things as you see fit. That includes spelling or grammatical errors but also factional errors I probably have made, but you noticed. Once you found something you have the possiblity to change it. This change will not be in effect immediately. You will prupose a change to me. Once you did that, I will get a message and check if this change is something I agree to or not. So you do NOT have the ability to just change anything and possibly destroy some of my work. However if anyone has made themselves known and wants to do more or even work together on something with me for ao3, then I can allow them more rights to work on something with me. If I trust them and we want to write something together. Be it a chapter which you write for a story or a completely joined venture. For which that person will gain full recognition here and on ao3 with their respective usernames. I say that as a possibility to for one show you the advantages of this site as well as the possibilities with me, if we find common ground.

### How to contribute
As said before, you will need a GitHub account.

> [!NOTE]
> I personally would recommend to use a new private account, even if you have one for two reasons:
> 1. Privacy: Using your real name on the internet can always be a risk. Esspecially if you work as a software developer or use github for professional projects, even if they are private, because your collegues and friends as well as the whole internet can see, that you contributed here and what. I am not ashamed of anything here, but I don't know how you explain to your friends, that you read a Star Wars lemon fic and just had to rectify an error you found. But in the end that is your decision.
> 2. Recognisability: If you make a new account, maybe with the same username as on ao3, then it is easier to be active on both and be seen as the same person.

I have prepeared a few screenshots, which will show you how you can contribute to a fic and maybe change some errors.

> [!NOTE]
> Be warned, I can not approve your pruposed changes, so I have no danger of losing my work. BUT every change request stays visible to others and can be viewed by all, even if they do not have an account. So consider carefully what trolling you want to conduct. I expect it, but still.

![Screenshot showing first step of contribution, which is to click the little pen symbol at the top of a file](/Guides/GFX/Contribute1.PNG)
1. In the first step you have to press the little pen symbol at the top of the text view. In this case it is the main README file of the repository, but it always is the same. You can see the placement within the red square at position 1.

![Screenshot showing the second step of contribution, which is to fork the repository](/Guides/GFX/Contribute2.PNG)
2. This screenshot shows what you will see once you completed step 1. Here you are asked to fork the repository, as you can see within the red square at position 1. Normally you will be given a possibility to read some documentation on what GitHub want's from you in a moment like this. As is shown here with the link below the green "Fork this repository" button. But in this case I will explain. A fork is basically just you copying my repository, so everything which is in there, to a repository with the same name which is part of your account. With this copy you can do anything and write anything you want but that won't effect the original repository i.e. this one. For contribution you make changes to your copy of this repository and once you have made all changes you want, you can save those changes for your version and then basically send a request to me, to make these changes part of the original, which will be shown in the next steps. This step will not always be the same, as you will have to fork the repository only once. But there may be other things GitHub asks of you. I will not go into those right now, but with reading what is prompted and looking at the documentation or consulting someone who knows - like me - you can master them as well. If the need arises and you don't know what to do and don't get anywhere with your own efforts, please contact me, or use the "Discussion" feature of my repository, which will be explained in one of the next chapters.

![Screenshot showing the third step of contribution, which is making your change and commiting it](/Guides/GFX/Contribute3.PNG)
3. For step three you can finally make that change you wanted to make. In this case I just changed the heading of the main README file, as can be seen within the red square with the number 1. Once you made your changes you can press the green button at the top right, encased in the red square with the number 2. With this your changes get commit to your copy and in the next step you can prupose those changes to me. If you need to change more than one file for one change request, you will have to do another approach. If this need arises and you cannot get it to work on your own, then contact me.

![Screenshot showing the fourth step of contribution, which is to send me the changes to approve and add them](/Guides/GFX/Contribute4.PNG)
4. After completing the third step you will be shown this view and can now Propose the changes to me with pressing the green button within the red square numbered 1. Before that, you can specify "Commit message" and a "description" in the box which contains that green button. I would ask you to do this and give me information on why changes happened, IF they are not obvious on their own, then you could also leave the default.

![Screenshot showing the last step of contribution, which is to send the pull request](/Guides/GFX/Contribute5.PNG)
5. For the last step you get this screen shown in the screenshot, which is a way for you to check if everything is as you wanted it. Then you press the green button within the red square named "Create pull request". You don't have to change anything else. Once you press the button, I will receive your request. "Pull request" means that you have changes and propose them and I look at them and if I want them "pull" them into the original. Congratulations, you made it to the end and have contributed to the fanfiction.

## Discussions
![Screenshot of thze front page showing an red encircled Discussion tab](/Guides/GFX/Discussion.PNG)

In this screenshot you can see the front page and a red square around the tab for Discussions. Discussions are basically the comment section on GitHub. Here you can converse and talk with the comunity if you want to.
