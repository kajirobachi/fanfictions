# Guides
In this section I will take a bit of time to explain the workings of GitHub to you. At least what you need to know to be able to work with my fanfictions as I have intended. Please don't feel like as if I thought you were stupid. But to be inclusive with everyone and their level of understanding for technology, I will explain things exhaustively and in detail. If you understand faster than others, please just continue on to the sections which interest you or you want to learn from. Thank you.

## Site Traversal
Firstly and most importantly, you need to know how to use this site and be able to find and read the fanfictions you want.

### Traversal by directory structure

Above you can see the Frontpage of this repository. I added two red squares to explain certain sections to you. The first square which is the one at the bottom contains text, just like the text you are reading now. When you made your way here, you already made yourself familiar with this site space which will contain all textual content. Be it a guide like this, or a fanfiction itself. 

The second square which is on the top, contains the view of all the folders and files which are contained within this repository. At least the top level view of those. This works exactly as the file system on your computer or smartphone. To go into one of the folders you just click on it, which opens it to show you its contents. As the contents of this repository might progress, there is the possibility that there are more folders on the frontpage now, than are on the picture above, don't let that deter you. Same old, same old. For this demonstration I will click on the "Naruto" folder at the top if you want to follow allong. Please see how this looks like in the next screenshot:

Here you can see the view you will get once you click one of the folders on the front page, in this case the "Naruto" folder. The overlay and site structure has changed a bit, but everything important to you is still in the center of the site. New is the section on the left side, which is encased with the red square numbered 1. Here you see the directory structure of the whole repository, with the top level "Naruto" folder now opened. In this case other subfolders of this "Naruto" folder are also opened up, which will not be the case for you, if you follow along with this guide. This is because I already extended those other folders for this screenshot, so I can explain something in a moment.

The second square encases another view of the directory structure. In this case it shows the contents of the "Naruto" folder. On the frontpage, this section showed the top level contents of the repository, now it has moved to the contents of the folder we just clicked and selected. Both of these views can be used to traverse the repository. Below this second square you can see the same section, which shows some text. This text gets automatically opened.

From the complete view on the left, within the first square, you can click on any of the folders or files to open them and see their contents. As you might notice on the left side of each folder, there is a little arrow or triangular form, which misses on side of the triangle. This can be used to extend and close folders within this section. This is what I did, to open up more of the folders as an example for you. Now I could click on the "Oneshot.md" file to Open the Oneshot itself.

From the content view within the second square, you can click the folders or files shown as before on the front page. The folder which has the name ".." represent the back button. Pressing this, will move you one folder layer up. In this case back to the top layer which was shown on the front page, but in deeper subfolder structures you just go up to the folder encasing this one.

### Traversal by embedded links
![Picture of the main README File on the Frontpage scrolled down to the end of the text](/Guides/GFX/MainReadmeBotton.PNG)

In the above screenshot you see the text which is displayed on the frontpage, once you have scrolled down to the bottom (at a later point this might look different, but the information described here still holds true.) In the red square there with the one you can see three bullet points. For each the text is blue and underlined. This is a link. If you click on that text, another site within this repository will be opened. As described in the chapter before this one, you can use the folder structures to traverse the repository, but you can also use those links to do so. If you would click on the second bulled point in the red square you would be led to the same page as if you clicked on the "Naruto" folder at the top, resulting in the same view as shown in the second screenshot of the last chapter.

On all Text views you will find these blue and underlined texts and can use them to traverse the whole document. The links are always named for what they will leed to. Usually you will find the equivalent of a back button at the bottom of each page. In this case there is a link you can see on the screenshot, which will just send you back to the top of the page, as it is the front page and has nothing to go back to. In some cases, the "back" link, will lead to a overview page one layer up, which may not be where you traversed from, as there are multiple ways to come to some of the pages.

## Naming conventions
The naming conventions of the files and folders aim for expressiveness and clarity. Still I will explain them none the less.

![Picture of the Naruto subfolder with two red squares, one which encases the directory structure on the left and the second which encases the directory structure in the top center](/Guides/GFX/NarutoSubFolder.PNG)

I reuse on of the screenshots from the [Traversal by directory structure](#traversal-by-directory-structure) chapter here, which shows different folders and files in the red square numbered one. From the top layer, the folders will be named after the fandom they hold stories of. There may be other folders which are not concerned with them like the "Guides" folder, but the most interesting ones for you will probably be the directly fanfiction related ones anyway. Under those there will be folders like "Oneshots" or "Series" differentiating between types of stories. In the screenshot at position one, the Naruto folder at this time only held a "Oneshots" folder. No matter what story differentiation was selected inside will the folders which directly correspond to the story which they hold and share the same name.

In those story folders like the "Can love fix this" folder in the screenshot at position 1, you can see two files. One named "README" and the other "Oneshot". The "Oneshot" file is the story or oneshot in this case itself and if selected will show the story ready to be read. In longer story formats there may exist files like "Chapter 1" and so forth instead. In almost any folder you will find a "README" file. This is a naming convention used by GitHub itself. When you open a folder it will search it for a "README" file and if it finds one, it will automatically display its contents in the text area. Personally I would use a different naming convention for my use case here, but i think it is understandable enough. Because these files get automatically opened, they contain Information about the context they are in. The "README" file on the front page contains the general information about the repository. One in a fandom folder contains information about the fandom and another inside a story folder contains information like summaries and tags as well as warnings of the story.

## Why GitHub?
Why would anyone want to use GitHub for their writing in the first place? Before I can answer that question I should quickly define what GitHub is used for and what benefits it provides for anyone who writes stories of any kind and how that can benefit the readers and who they could contribute to the stories directly, if the author so choses.

### What is GitHub
GitHub is a service used primarily by software developers and people who have anything to do with creating or promoting software. Underlying the service is a tool named git. Git has some different uses but let me explain. Say you want to write a story. You begin writing and have a file named "MyStory". You write for a few hours, before you quit for the day. The next day you come back and reread what you have written but find some errors and a section you do not fancy anymore so you delete and replace it with something else, as well as adding more to the story. The next day you do the same, but notice that what you have deleted the day before would have fit better with what you now want the story to be. But damn it... you deleted that yesterday and hit save for the file, no way to get it back, so you have to write it again and approximate it as best as you can, but what you end up with is not as good as what you had before. You make a copy of the file, one containing the changes you made yesterday and the other your rewrite from this day. You keep writing with the second file and keep the other just in case. similar things happen and now you have 10 different files, with different versions of the story - some with small differences, some with big - and one master file, in which you keep the current status as you want it. A bit exagerated maybe, but if you have ever written something creative, the chances are high, that you know what I am talking about.

Now you have this tool named git, which helps with exactly those two problems. Versioning and change management. Let's redo the example one more time, but this time we use git as a tool to help us. As before you begin writing a story and have one file containing it. Once you are finished for the day you open your git tool and add this file to your new repository for this story, which will hold any files you need for it. This is the innital state of your story and you "commit" it meaning you save the file to this repository as well as its state. The next day you add more to the story and fix a few more errors. Which you then commit again. The file is already part of the repository so you just commit the new state. After you realize that a part you wrote yesterday isn't something you like, so you delete and rewrite it. Once again commiting this change. The next day you want it back. What now? You have the file in the repository. After you deleted the part you saved, as before, and can't get the old version back from it, as before. But you remember, that you have used the git tool as well. Going into it, you see that you have three commits. The initial one, the one for the changes on the second day and the one where you deleted that part you want back now. With the tool you can just revert that deletion and the file is back in the state from right after the second commit and you can continue working with the part you wanted back in the file again. As you keep writing you are not sure which parts to use at some points, with major differences to the story. For this you can use the tool to save different states simultaniously, saving these versions which you later can pick from or put together as you want. With this, you just have one file and all changes from the very beginning available to you, so you can revert to any which you want and see what you added and changed at what point in time.

GitHub itself is just an extention to the git tool, which you would use locally on your computer. GitHub allows to save that repository on the internet, so you can pull it to different computers if you want to work on multiple machines, which all share the same information. Also you can make the repository public so other people can see your writing or code in the traditional sense and use it as they want, by the definitions of usage you have set. Other people can also colaborate on the files if you want. Allowing for different people to work on the same file, without the need to copy it, so that versions don't get overwritten and things get deleted, that shouldn't be. There are other sites that offer the same services, but GitHub is dare I say the most well known in the software space, so I use it as well. There are also many other things it can be used for, but those would not be beneficial to describe here right now.

### Benefits of GitHub in writing
This is basically the Tl;dr version of the chapter directly before this, as it describes what GitHub can be used for. So for more information read that chapter, if you have skipped it. The key benefits for using GitHub for writing are the following:

- Change management (each change since inception of the story can be revisited and reverted to if need be)
- Version management (you can keep many different version of the story at the same time, with only one file and change between them)
- Contributions (Other people or the readers can directly interact with the content and help form it -> more on that in the next chapter)
