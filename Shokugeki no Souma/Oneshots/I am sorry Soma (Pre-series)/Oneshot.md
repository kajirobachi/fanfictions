# I am sorry Soma

“Oh, come on Nakiri, just taste it! It is good and you know it is.” Yukihira Soma exclaimed a little irritated as he tailed Nakiri Erina who tried to evade him once again. For the uninitiated this would seem worrisome, but to the rest of their friends this was just a normal everyday occurrence.

“\*Sigh\* are they at it again?” Megumi asked rhetorically as she watched their banter continue. This was really not the time for a scene like this, she thought. They were in the middle of an exam and there where a lot of high standing and important individuals around who acted as the taste testers. The situation was already as tense as it could be and now those two had to play their dumb game again.

“No, I will not! I have more important things to do than to taste your trashy food. It will be disgusting anyway.” Erina huffed as she stomped around the hall, Soma right at her tail.

“Like what? The exam will continue just fine, even if you step away for a minute or two. Nobody would even notice.” Soma sighed. Nobody had noticed besides Megumi, but Soma seemed more and more exhausted the last few weeks. Maybe it was because he tried so hard to make something special for Erina so she would finally admit what she really thought about his food. Megumi had asked him about it, but he had just shrugged it off, not seeing a problem. She saw a problem though. She did not understand why Erina was so adamant to call his food disgusting when everyone knew she was not believing her own words in the slightest. And it all but angered her to see her best friend in this exhausted state because of it.

“I am the headmistress, I cannot just step away for a few minutes, it would not be befitting for my standing.” Erina continued her nose held high and her checks puffed. The way she was behaving right now was not befitting, not that Megumi would ever say that to her face.

“Then I will feed you while you walk, one bite is all you need to say it is delicious!” Soma chuckled, to which Erina stopped in her track almost making him run into her as she turned around with a sharp motion, her hair hitting his face.

“Now listen here Yukihira! I will never call your food anything but disgusting, you second grade chef, so just let me be with this topic already!” She snapped, Soma visibly wincing at that. Megumi felt anger boil up inside of her at that treatment for the umpteenth time, but as she looked to Erina, she could see her immediate regret. Guilt all over her face. So she breathed a sigh and let it play out; at least she intended it to.

“Soma…” Erina started but was cut off before she could say anything. 

“Headmistress. Is this one bothering you? Should we remove him?” A slimy voice erupted, as he walked up behind her with a few of his buddies. Erina did not need an introduction, he was one of their contractors, named Ebisu. She hated him with a passion, but Totsuki needed his services, so she had to keep her manners. He and his “friends” he gathered around him, had their hands deep into the shipping business and if he wanted them to, they would stop delivering altogether, which could cut off Totsuki from a lot of important goods, which could not easily and most importantly cheaply be replaced. 

“N-No, Ebisu-san I can handle this on my own. But thank you.” She said with the friendliest voice she could muster. 

“Oh, I am sure you can, but who knows what this roughian would potentially do to you, when you not obliged to his wishes. I could not just stand by in such a case, so at least let me be at your side, until he has been removed.” He continued smiling smugly at Soma, who just stared back at him with cold eyes. He seemed to be calm, but even Erina could make out his trembling fists he had placed in his pockets. She was at a loss of words.

“So” Ebisu continued, now walking up to Soma sticking his face right up to his, “this is the current first seat I have heard so much about. Yukihira Soma.”

“You may be the first seat out of a bit of luck, but do not forget where you stand, passant!” He spat disgust now plastered all over his face. Soma seemed not to be impressed by this and kept looking into the others eyes.

“And where would that be?” He asked coldly

“Well, outside in the rain for example.” Ebisu joked, his friends who now had surrounded Soma laughing and giggling at his every word.

“You know, I cannot do anything about the others out there, eating the shit you call food out of your hands and on top of that letting you pass this exam. But at least the headmistress seems to agree with me, that your food just is disgusting and is not even befitting of dogs. Isn’t that right?” He sang, the venom spilling from his words, as he looked at Erina behind him. She seemed to be caught of guard, still not able to say anything.

Their friends stood by as all this happened, unable to do anything, as it would only escalate the situation even more. The only one able to defuse it now, was Erina.

“I’ve heard you force her almost every day to eat your disgusting food, to make her say that it is delicious. What a lowly thing to do. To force the god tongue to eat your food. Still, she never has called it delicious, has she? Do you not feel ashamed to keep trying, even though you know she never would say what you want her to, no matter how much you threaten her. Isn’t that right miss Nakiri?” Ebisu just continued, forcing Erina more and more into a corner.

Megumi was fuming, Erina just had to call his food delicious now and all of this would have an end. All these men where after, was to destroy Yukihiras standing. They were very well aware, that if the god tongue officially denounced his food, his reputation would take a hit. So why was she still silent.

“Erina?” Soma asked in a low and hollow voice, that gave Megumi goosebumps. She had never heard him like this. He was staring at Erina, and she was staring back, petrified.

“Y-Yes.” She stammered, “his food is… disgusting, and I could never call it anything but.”

Megumis jaw dropped to the ground, as were the ones of her friends around her. Erina could not be serious, could she?

Soma was still staring at her, pain visible in his eyes and the colour slowly leaving his face. Megumi could literally see, how something in her best friend had just died.

Soma stared at Erinas eyes, seeing the shock at her own words in them, but was not able to hold that contact, looking at the floor. The tirades from the men around him continued, tenfold now, but he could not hear it. Everything hurt, his every heartbeat sending jolts of pain through his entire being. He could not believe her. He knew she did not mean it and that she had been cornered right now, but still that was no excuse. Not anymore. She just had thrown him under the bus, because she could not admit to it. She would rather see him suffer endlessly before acknowledging him. He felt tired all of a sudden, the fatigue finally catching up to him. The last three weeks he had worked day and night, creating and creating one after the other outstanding dishes, to make her say it. Megumi had noticed, how tired he was, but he had brushed it off. Now he could feel it. His entire beeing heavy and damaged, tired of moving. And most of all he was tired of her and her treatment of him. There was no justification for it. Nothing that made what she just did okay. You do not do that to your friends, and it wasn’t even necessary to begin with, she could have just stayed silent if she didn't want to escalate the situation.

Erina had a breakdown of her own. She couldn’t believe what she just said. She did not want to say it, she did not want to see him this broken. Ever. She doesn’t know why she always hates on his food, when she knows that it isn’t disgusting. She couldn’t hear a word of what Ebisu and his friends were saying, she was just staring at Soma, hoping he would lift his head and look at her. But he didn’t.

It took another ten minutes before Ebisu and his posy had enough and were bored, stomping off to somewhere else, they could hate on someone else’s food or now even spout what just had transpired. With them leaving followed a few moments of silence. Everyone else had left during the show only Megumi and their friends were still there. They now came closer to the two standing there like statues.

“S-Soma? Are you alright?” Megumi stammered as she was close enough to him. This seemed to pull both of them out of their respective trances as they looked at her.

“Ye-Yeah. Actually no… I don’t think so.” Soma sighed closing his eyes again. This solicited a unified gasp from everyone, Yukihira Soma would never admit to not feeling well.

“Som…” Erina started but was cut off by him.

“Don ‘t.” He interjected, taking a moment to look at her. She was standing in front of him, her hands clasped before her bosom and her eyes screamed at him with the horror she must be feeling. It didn't irk him though. He did not care anymore. He did not feel anything for that matter. He felt just empty, betrayed even. He would not hold it against her. Maybe she really just hated him and his food, not that that would be a problem anymore.

“Don’t worry.” He said, making her look in surprise. “I won’t bother you with me or my food ever again.” He said with a monotone voice, looking her dead in the eyes. She opened her mouth, but nothing came out. He waited for another few seconds, before sighing and turning around leaving the room. His friends staying behind in stupor.

Erina fell to her knees as Soma turned the corner, holding her head in her hands, staring at the ground.

“What have you done?” Megumi asked, her anger no longer containable.

“Why would you do something like that?!” She spat at Erina. Making her friends recoil. Megumi never was angry. They never even heard her speak loudly.

“I-I don’t know…” Erina stuttered.

Everyone was silent, nobody knew what to do. Eventually they all recovered and with the help of Hisako, who had seen everything as well, even Erina was moving again. Soma was nowhere to be found though. They couldn’t just leave and search for him, Erina least of all, so they had to wait till the exam was over and their jobs done, before they rushed outside in a search for him. Erina was close to a breakdown, she just needed to see her redhead and apologize, she didn’t know what to say, but Megumi had made her promise she would.
