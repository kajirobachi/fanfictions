# Fanfictions
Hello and welcome to my collection of fanfiction stories! This repository is a place where I share my creative works, spanning different universes, genres, and fandoms. Whether you're here for a short oneshot or a long, multi-chapter series, I hope you'll find something that sparks your imagination.

## What's Inside
This repository is organized by fandoms or universes, and each universe contains a collection of oneshots and series based on that world. You can navigate through the folders to explore stories from different fandoms.

In addition, you’ll find a special section for **Pre-Series Oneshots**, where you can read oneshots that are eligible to become full-fledged series. Feel free to vote on your favorite oneshots to help decide which stories get continued!

## Guides
